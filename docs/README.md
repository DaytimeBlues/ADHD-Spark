# Documentation Index

## Canonical product docs

- `PRD.md` — canonical product requirements document.
- `TECH_SPEC.md` — architecture and implementation details.
- `DESIGN_RULES.md` — UI/UX constraints and design system rules.
- `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md` — security controls and release checks.
- `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` — release workflow.
- `GOOGLE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` — Google auth/sync setup.

## Planning docs

Planning artifacts remain in `docs/planning/` for historical reference.
Do not treat planning docs as canonical requirements unless explicitly linked
from current tickets.

## Notes

- `docs/PRD.md` is the single source of truth for product requirements.
- Binary research files (`*.pdf`, `*.docx`) should live outside git history.
