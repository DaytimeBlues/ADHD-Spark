On the left, a vertical stack of interlocking puzzle pieces in various pastel colors (pink, light green, light blue, orange, light purple) forms a partial column. On the right, a dark gray silhouette of a hand is placing a light blue puzzle piece into a vertical, incomplete chain of similar pastel puzzle pieces. In the top right corner, there's a small icon of three stacked sheets of paper with a "Photocopiable" label below it. The title "J. Russell Ramsay & Anthony L. Rostain" is in a smaller font above the main title "THE ADULT ADHD TOOL KIT" which is in a large, bold, sans-serif font, colored white against a teal background band. Below the main title, the subtitle "Using CBT to Facilitate Coping Inside and Out" is in a smaller white font. A small Routledge logo (a stylized 'R' with a person's silhouette) is on the bottom right, also in white.

A central source of frustration for most adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is that they know what they need to do, but they have difficulties turning their intentions into actions. These difficulties also interfere with their ability to use self-help books and to get the most out of psychosocial treatments that provide coping strategies that promise to improve their functioning. Drs. Ramsay and Rostain are experts in the assessment and treatment of adult ADHD and are leaders in the development of effective psychosocial treatments for this group of patients. Their newest book, *The Adult ADHD Tool Kit: Using CBT to Facilitate Coping Inside and Out*, is a coping guide for adults living with ADHD, one that does not just present useful coping strategies but also provides specific tactics designed to help readers implement these skills in their daily lives and brings them to life in a user-friendly format. The authors discuss many different settings in which ADHD may cause difficulties, including work, school, matters of physical health and well-being, and the issue of excessive use of technology. Although written for consumers, clinicians will find the book to be a clinically useful tool for their adult patients with ADHD, serving as a companion to the newly updated and expanded second edition of Drs. Ramsay and Rostain’s professional treatment manual *Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Adult ADHD: An Integrative Psychosocial and Medical Approach*.

# Preface

Benjamin Franklin said, “You may delay, but time will not, and lost time is never found again.” We are two mental health professionals by trade, a psychologist (J. Russell Ramsay—JRR) and a psychiatrist (Anthony L. Rostain—ALR), who specialize in assessing and treating adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) through our Adult ADHD Treatment and Research Program at the University of Pennsylvania, the institution founded by Franklin. Most patients who seek out our program want to be better able to set out and follow through on their plans, including academic and work tasks, keeping up with errands and personal affairs, and any number of other personally relevant endeavors. The solution seems as simple and obvious as a well-known advertising campaign—“Just do it!” This maxim is not unfamiliar to adults with ADHD; in fact, the core underlying difficulties that define ADHD are directly related to the mechanisms that allow us to “do it.”

Discussions of ADHD focus a great deal on the “A” and the “H,” with the name of the diagnosis and resulting acronym being somewhat misleading. Yes, “A” and “H” represent its symptoms, but they do not adequately describe the ADHD syndrome. ADHD is currently understood as a disorder related to poor self-regulation or self-control—adults with ADHD have problems turning their intentions into the actions that are required to handle many of the demands of daily life. More specifically, it is difficult for adults with ADHD to proactively and consistently develop, organize, and enact and follow through on plans over time for which there is a future (but not immediate) pay off. Instead, ADHD adults repeatedly face the stress of looming deadlines or crisis situations that result from putting off tasks, only being provoked to action by an emergency situation on par with trying to defuse a ticking time bomb.

Think of all the stories and fables we learned as children about the virtues of planning ahead and persevering on a task, such as the little pig that built a house of bricks, the tortoise who keeps a steady pace over a long race with the hare, religious teachings about the benefits of self-restraint and self-control (“Thou shalt NOT . . .”), etc. Each lesson involves deferring immediate gratification for a greater but distant reward. A famous study of self-control led by Walter Mischel had children sit alone in a room with a plate of sweet treats. The children were told that they could have a single treat of their choice, but if they could wait without eating it until the examiner returned to the room, they could earn a second one. Some children, despite the promise of greater reward, succumbed to the temptation to eat the single treat, losing out on the bonus; other children were able to resist temptation long enough to earn the reward of a second treat. The main finding of interest in what has come to be known as the “marshmallow study” is that the impulse control exhibited in childhood predicted later success at all points in life, with the children who were able to defer gratification being better off on average, even 40 years later (Mischel et al., 2011).

Although the lessons and solutions seem straightforward and have been reinforced by grandparents, parents, teachers, bosses, fairy tales, cautionary tales, etc., self-regulation is more multifaceted than it seems. There are many fundamental skills that provide humans with the capacity to do what they want to do or need to do when they need to do it. These skills, known as the executive functions, operate in an exquisite choreography to help us navigate the myriad demands of adult life. Hence, ADHD is currently understood as a disorder of impaired executive functions. That is, the farther in the future the reward for a behavior lay, the greater difficulty an adult with ADHD will have performing the necessary component steps in the here-and-now, thus decreasing the likelihood of achieving the payoff (despite full awareness of the consequences). Alas, the penalties for poor self-control in adulthood are much steeper than the loss of a marshmallow.

ADHD also involves distinct motivational deficits inasmuch as motivation is considered the ability to generate emotions that help you to engage in a task without relying solely on an immediate reward or consequence. Adults with ADHD have difficulties accomplishing jobs that range from setting up a retirement fund (“I’ll get around to it later. I have time.”) to something as immediate as mowing the lawn on a weekend afternoon (“I’ll get around to it later. I have time.”).

As was mentioned earlier, we established and have operated a specialized clinical program for the assessment and treatment of adult ADHD since 1999. An established treatment for ADHD is pharmacotherapy, the use of medications to treat the core symptoms of developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity. Similar to obtaining corrective prescription eyeglasses, effective medication treatment of ADHD reduces the symptoms of ADHD, such as improving the ability to sustain attention and to reduce restlessness and impulsivity. Although an effective and safe treatment for most adults with ADHD, medications alone do not necessarily improve behavioral functioning and well-being in one’s day-to-day life. That is, you may be less prone to distraction and fidgetiness while on a medication, but you will not spontaneously complete your income taxes or get started on a monthly report for work.

The other treatment we provide at our program is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a specific form of psychotherapy that has been adapted to address problems commonly encountered by adults with ADHD. The cognitive in CBT refers to the thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes that affect how we perceive and react to events, as well as our self-perception. Negative thinking has no causal influence on having ADHD, although it often develops as a consequence of growing up and living with ADHD and trying to manage its effects on your life. Said differently, you did not develop difficulties organizing and following through on tasks because you have negative thoughts about them; however, the repeated difficulties you have experienced because of ADHD have likely given rise to pessimistic outlooks about these tasks, which, along with even residual symptoms of ADHD, create a double whammy and make it even harder to follow through on them, that is, insufficient motivation.

The behavioral in CBT refers to one’s actions and to the therapeutic process of developing a more adaptive behavioral repertoire with which to cope with ADHD. Once more, having ADHD does not result from the fact that self-control behaviors were not adequately emphasized by your parents when you were a child or from eating too much sugar-coated cereal. Indeed, individuals with ADHD “know” quite well how to handle the situations that cause them problems. Ask a grade school student with severe ADHD what he should do if he knows the answer to a question asked by the teacher during class, and he will correctly answer, “Raise my hand and wait to be called on by the teacher.” The crux of the problem is that ADHD interferes with the student’s execution of the behaviors required to obey this rule during class.

CBT for adult ADHD, as in other “talk” psychotherapies, involves regularly scheduled office meetings. By necessity, these meetings occur outside the environments in which individuals with ADHD experience the difficulties that bring them to treatment. The necessary solutions for the common problems related to managing ADHD are obvious and logical—use of a planner, getting started earlier on tasks, spending time organizing files, etc.—but the problem is carrying out these solutions in your daily life at the “point of performance.”

In a nutshell, our goal for this tool kit is to share the ways we have tried to make the coping tools for adult ADHD “sticky” so that they will stay with you and you will be able to use them to positive effect in your day-to-day life.

The purpose of this handbook is to serve as a coping resource for adults with ADHD in order to increase the consistent use of effective coping strategies that will improve one’s ability to manage his or her daily affairs. Of course, the notion of a “self-help” or “do-it-yourself” book for adult ADHD, a condition that we have already identified as a problem related to poor self-regulation (i.e., core difficulties with self-help), might seem oxymoronic—or maybe just moronic. The executive function/motivational deficit definition of ADHD we described would make it seem that ADHD interferes with your ability to make changes in a do-it-yourself fashion. We do not expect that simply reading about what you need to do will make you more productive. If that were the case, any one of the excellent books on adult ADHD already on the market would have sufficed.

Rather, we envision this book as akin to a tool kit, an assemblage of a variety of coping tools that can be accessed whenever needed. The strategies herein have been adapted to the needs of adults with ADHD, acknowledging and addressing the very problems that make it difficult to use them. Hence, we emphasize implementation tactics that will increase the likelihood of using these skills at the point of performance, and so that they will be used enough that they will become habitual and less effortful, akin to tasks such as brushing your teeth, making coffee in the morning, or any other task you reliably perform, even on your worst day. Of course, if you find that you have drifted away from using the skills, you can return to a relevant section of the tool kit for a refresher.

Psychologists, counselors, or other nonphysician mental health professionals cannot write prescriptions for medications; however, we can write “behavioral prescriptions” or written reminders of important behavioral strategies. One of the reasons CBT for adult ADHD has been found to be an effective psychosocial treatment for adult ADHD is the focus on the use of coping skills during the 167 hours of the week outside of the weekly therapy hour. Spending time planning how to implement coping strategies during the week and writing out summary coping reminders of the plan increases the likelihood of the timely practice of coping principles outside of the office.

Thus, in addition to discussing foundational coping skills for adult ADHD, many sections of the tool kit will include straightforward “take away” points comprised of a list of step-by-step reminders for instituting them. These take away points offer reminders that can be referred to or carried with you to help you to turn intentions into actions when it counts. Similar to having a recipe for cooking, even if you say “I cannot cook,” you are able to follow each of the individual steps required to prepare a basic dish. The implementation of these strategies sets the stage for the most powerful source of reinforcement in developing coping skills for adult ADHD, which is your “felt experience” when carrying out a plan, seeing positive results, and gaining confidence in your ability to handle situations that previously seemed overwhelming. Just as with cooking, you can personalize the recipes to your unique circumstances, but at the very least, they provide an anchor point to help you get started (or restarted when dealing with coping drift).

This clinical tool kit reflects the principles, skills, and methods used in our clinic, which are very similar to those used by other clinicians with an expertise in adult ADHD. While many of the coping strategies will be familiar to readers of other books on managing adult ADHD, we have tried to emphasize the factors that promote the implementation of the coping skills combined with specific tactics to use in real time. These factors work together to make your coping plans “sticky” so that they go with and are more likely to be carried out and that you can get “unstuck” in various situations in your life.

Of course, no book will be able to address each and every situation you will face, but we have attempted to cover the most common problem areas encountered by adults with ADHD in a way that can be generalized to other situations. We have organized the book in a logical sequence of coping skills from the basics of using prioritizing tasks and your daily schedule to dealing with procrastination and negative thinking to handling different roles in your life as well as maintaining overall well-being. Although adults with ADHD as a group encounter many common and familiar difficulties, each person’s coping needs will be different. Hence, readers are invited to jump to chapters relevant to their specific coping issues and need not read the book in order from beginning to end.

We encourage you to look for ways to get started using the coping skills outlined in the coming chapters but to also be patient with yourself during the change process. We hope that by finding ways to implement these strategies in your daily life, you will notice improvements. However, this sort of change process often involves taking two or three steps forward and then one step backward. Change is hard work and it is important for you to recognize and appreciate progress, even if it is not perfect. For example, maybe a college student reports that he now hands in 80% of his assignments on time after having a semester when he was on time with only 50% of them. Although he strives for 100% timeliness and views himself as still falling short of his goal, we use the reframe that “If you and I invented a medication that helped someone improve this behavior by the same 30% you have achieved, we’d be billionaires right now.” These sorts of positive changes are valid, important to recognize, and will result in improved quality of life without having to use perfection as the benchmark.

To this end, our final wish is that you will use and overuse this tool kit. That is, as with our attempts to provide evidence-supported treatments for adult ADHD that can be personalized, this tool kit provides a useful framework of skills that you and others with ADHD can use and make your own. Using the metaphor of a tool kit, we provide some tools and some instructions for their use; you the reader can use these tools to build newfound opportunities and, more importantly, to be able to “stick with” your endeavors.

## A Note for Mental Health Clinicians

Although written as a handbook for adults with ADHD who are seeking useful coping strategies, this tool kit is also designed to be a resource for clinicians who treat adults with ADHD. This tool kit is a companion to the second edition of our treatment manual, *Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adult ADHD: An Integrative Psychosocial and Medical Approach* (Ramsay & Rostain, 2015), which provides information about the theoretical underpinnings of the CBT model for adult ADHD, the case conceptualization, more detailed discussion of many of the strategies in this tool kit, reviews of case examples and clinical challenges, and a review of the empirical support for this and similar CBT approaches for adult ADHD. We do not have a session-by-session prescription of topics to address, although this tool kit represents the way we divide up and implement coping skills with patients in sessions.

The development of this handbook stemmed from feedback provided by readers of the first edition of the treatment manual. The most common request was for even more specifics about coping strategies and the “nitty gritty” of how to implement CBT for adult ADHD. Hence, we have tried to encapsulate what we do in collaboration with our patients, including the emphasis on the use and implementation of these skills in daily life, which is the primary measure of their effectiveness. That is to say, we not only discuss the coping strategies but also discuss more specific “tactics” for how they can be put to use.

The tool kit itself provides patients with an externalized reminder for therapeutic exercises to perform as well as a means for personalizing these skills. The take away reminders can be copied to serve as coping cards and provide a means to make between sessions therapeutic exercises “sticky” and portable in order to increase the likelihood that the skills will be implemented at the point of performance. The different chapters could also conceivably be used in a group format, with different chapters providing themes for each meeting.

# Acknowledgments

The authors wish to thank the Routledge/Taylor & Francis Group for supporting us throughout the process of writing this handbook. Dana Bliss was the editor on the first book we wrote and he enthusiastically supported our idea for *The ADHD Tool Kit*. After Dana left Routledge, Anna Moore stepped in and was an equally encouraging and capable guide through the rest of the process.

We would like to thank all of the past and present members of our team at the University of Pennsylvania’s Adult ADHD Treatment and Research Program. Operating a program such as ours requires a great deal of time management and organizational skills, and dedication by all involved to keep it running smoothly. We have been fortunate to work with a variety of talented colleagues and trainees in order to provide evidence-supported assessment and clinical services, as well as to provide training in adult ADHD to the next generation of clinicians.

JRR would like to thank my wife, Amy, and my daughters, Abigail and Brynn, for all the love and support they provide. My mother and sister also deserve thanks for their ongoing encouragement.

One of the principles discussed in this handbook is establishing a work station that becomes a target for and associated with productivity. To this end, JRR would like to give a special word of thanks to the whole team at Main Street Java in Souderton, PA, which is where the vast majority of this book was written (and it will likely be the location for future projects of mine).

ALR would like to thank my wife, Michele, for her forbearance and encouragement, and my family and friends for “being there” for me through thick and thin. ALR also thanks my close colleagues at Penn along with the psychiatry residents whom I’ve had the distinct pleasure of supervising over the years—for providing me with intellectual stimulation and honest feedback.

Finally, we both wish to acknowledge the patients living with ADHD whom we have been privileged to serve since our program started in 1999. We have been awed and moved by their various accounts of adversities in their lives, and inspired by the spirit and strength with which they take on the hard work of facing and transcending ADHD. All of the advice we offer in this handbook has come from our clinical work, and thus we view this book as a tribute to adults with ADHD.

# 1 Introduction

“I know what I need to do, but I just don’t do it. I’ve tried to change on my own, I’ve tried self-help books, and nothing has worked. How is this tool kit going to help me deal with my ADHD when nothing else has worked?”

## Why Should I Expect That This Tool Kit Is Going to Help Me?

This is a reasonable question, but, as with many issues pertaining to Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults, the answer to the simple question is multifaceted.

First, most of the coping skills we will discuss in this tool kit are probably similar, if not identical to those you will find in the many popular books offering advice for coping with adult ADHD. ADHD is not a problem of lack of knowledge about what to do, but rather, it is a performance problem—being unable to reliably do what you set out to do.

Second, because ADHD is a skill performance problem, the similarity of the coping strategies and approaches across different books and programs, and the repetition of this information, is not a bad thing; in fact, having multiple and diverse reminders of these strategies helps to continually refresh the importance of these habits in your life. The combination of the review of the skills with slightly different presentations of these ideas across different formats provides a degree of novelty and offers you different takes on old ideas. Just as in learning, the diverse presentation of ideas and lessons increases the likelihood that these concepts will “stick” and come online during daily life when you need them the most. Diet and exercise books consistently place among the top sellers each year, not because previous books did not provide useful advice, but rather because it is difficult to change these behaviors.

Third, we have been posed a similar question by many patients seeking treatment through our Adult ADHD Treatment and Research Program at the University of Pennsylvania. The question usually takes the form of the one posed at the beginning of the chapter and ends with, “So, what is your treatment approach going to do for me that other treatments have not?”

Our answer has been, “We think we are good at helping adults with ADHD understand how they do not do things they set out to do.” When you are able to recognize in a nuanced and personalized way the ways in which ADHD interferes with your endeavors, you can then find many more pivot points at which to apply specific coping skills.

For example, many adults with ADHD aim to reduce procrastination. They set a goal to “not procrastinate” and attempt to do all the things that they know they are supposed to do—work on a project a little bit each day leading up to a deadline, have a plan of steps to follow, etc. However, most of these ADHD adults will end up falling into old patterns despite the goal to “not procrastinate” and despite the knowledge that they will regret putting things off. They may muddle through by using the pressure of a deadline to complete the task, but end up feeling frustrated and overwhelmed in the process.

It is not enough to know that you procrastinate, but you must understand how ADHD affects your procrastination as you go through your daily life. You need to be aware of the component parts of your procrastination profile. This framework helps you to “see” how you procrastinate and then to use some targeted skills to handle the specific barriers to your follow-through on tasks. Rather than the quick and familiar conclusion that you “procrastinated, again,” instead, you will have a better grasp of the interplay of the effects of ADHD on how you think about, feel about, and manage (or avoid) tasks. In turn, you can employ specific tactics that help you apply your skills in order to change your procrastination “script” (rather than doing the same thing again and hoping for a different outcome).

Fourth and finally, in addition presenting the coping skills that are known to be effective, we emphasize the implementation of these skills. Each of the chapters in this handbook includes discussions of the barriers to follow-through on coping strategies, ways to promote their use, and several step-by-step “take away” reminders for carrying out these skills. You know what you need to do, but understanding the barriers and having a hard copy of instructions akin to a recipe for doing what you need to do greatly increases the likelihood of getting unstuck and getting engaged. Keeping copies of these reminders handy in your daily life is a way to make the coping strategies portable so that you will use them when they are most needed.

Our approach asks a lot from you in terms of your commitment to change. The coping strategies and take away reminders are useful tools but are not immutable laws of physics—they must be used to be helpful. You will have to be willing to face and suspend your doubts about your ability to change. These doubts may be based on past frustrations or a view of yourself as being incapable of change. If your experiences are like those of the untold numbers of patients with ADHD we have seen, you have likely already invested a lot of time, effort, and money in trying to use these sorts of skills with disappointing or at least incomplete results. One of the myths about adult ADHD that we have encountered is the view that the diagnosis is “an excuse” or “an easy way out” of facing hard work. Our experience has been the exact opposite—most adults with ADHD whom we have encountered have worked long and hard to manage the effects of ADHD but grow frustrated with exerting such effort without getting a fair result, working “twice as hard for half as much,” as our professional colleague Dr. Steve Copps has said. We hope that the approach described in this handbook will help you to get much better returns from the investment of your time and efforts.

A starting point in this endeavor is to arrive at a shared understanding of what is ADHD in order to understand, in fact, what it is that you are trying to manage better. We will begin with a brief background on the diagnosis and history of ADHD. This review will conclude with a contemporary, scientifically supported model for understanding ADHD and the difficulties with disorganization, poor time management, impulsivity, procrastination, motivation, etc. that people experience in their daily lives. Finally, we will extend this model of ADHD to the coping strategies discussed in this tool kit, our emphasis on implementation, and provide the rationale for this handbook and set up a context for its use.

## Adult ADHD Background

Despite claims that ADHD is solely an outgrowth of the frenetic pace of 21st century lifestyles in Western society, there has likely been ADHD as long as there have been human brains. The date of the first appearance of ADHD-related phenomena in clinical writings has moved from 1902 and the publication of George Still’s (1902/2006) lectures on overactive and inattentive children to the late 18th century and the writings of the physician Alexander Crichton (1798/2008), and most recently, settling on 1775 and the observations of Melchior Adam Weikard (Barkley & Peters, 2012). The salient point is that ADHD is not a recent syndrome and that it has caused problems for affected individuals wherever and whenever it is found.

Nonetheless, the advent of compulsory education in the 20th century created a situation in which children entered classrooms, en masse. A classroom filled with children that is presided over by a single teacher for several hours of instruction is a setting that requires a reasonable degree of developmentally appropriate self-control. Moreover, this context shed light on behavioral and learning difficulties that may have been covered up in other situations (Hinshaw & Scheffler, 2014).

The syndrome now known as ADHD was given a variety of names over the years before being first described in the second edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-II; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1968) as the “hyperkinetic reaction of childhood (or adolescence)” with a 22-word description, including the assurance that “the behavior usually diminishes in adolescence.” The diagnosis was renamed as Attention Deficit Disorder (either with or without Hyperactivity) in DSM-III (APA, 1980) and DSM-III-R (APA, 1987). Many people continue to refer to the disorder as Attention Deficit Disorder or ADD, even though it was renamed as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in DSM-IV (APA, 1994). ADHD is listed in the fifth edition of (DSM-5; APA, 2013) under the section on neurodevelopmental disorders. ADHD can be further specified by different presentations: Predominantly Inattentive Presentation, Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive Presentation, and Combined Presentation.

Stimulant medications were found by accident to be a helpful treatment that led to improved attention and self-control in children. There have been studies of various forms of psychosocial and educational interventions to further improve functioning, mostly by adapting the child’s environment through teacher and parent training.

Research studies since the 1960s revealed that children with ADHD had ongoing difficulties into adolescence and adulthood, but the notion of adult ADHD did not gain wide notoriety until the 1990s with the publication of several popular books on the topic. Cross-sectional and longitudinal research has indicated that ADHD persists in well over 50% of children diagnosed with ADHD, probably closer to two-thirds of them. Lower persistence rates are often obtained when strict diagnostic criteria are used that may not adequately capture the manifestations of symptoms in adults with ADHD. It is estimated that 4.4% of the adult population in the United States exhibits ADHD, with similar prevalence rates (3.4%) obtained in international samples (Fayyad et al., 2007; Kessler et al., 2006).

The past 20+ years have witnessed a rise in genetic and neuroimaging research aimed at understanding the etiology of ADHD. For instance, ADHD is known to have complex genetic underpinnings for which there are different pathways and forms, unlike a simple genetic trait, such as eye color. The advent of neuroimaging technology has shed light on the architecture and workings of different brain regions implicated in the manifestations of ADHD. Multiple brain systems have been implicated in ADHD that individually and in concert add to our conceptualization of the symptoms of ADHD, as well as the variety of developmental trajectories and clinical presentations of the syndrome.

A meeting point for this and other research on ADHD has been the executive functions. Although difficult to define precisely, the executive functions have been described as higher-order cognitive skills that manage and choreograph a variety of brain functions in order to efficiently and adequately address the demands of our environment. Metaphors of “conductor” or “manager” often are invoked to illustrate the role of the executive functions on behavior.

ADHD is currently considered a developmental disorder of impaired executive functions. Using a definition established by Dr. Russell Barkley, the executive functions represent

> the use of self-directed actions so as to choose goals and to select, enact, and sustain actions across time toward those goals usually in the context of others often relying on social and cultural means for the maximization of one’s longer-term welfare as the person defines that to be.
> (Barkley, 2012, p. 176)

Said differently, individuals with ADHD have problems organizing and following through on tasks and endeavors that will create a desired long-term outcome, but for which there is not sufficient short-term reward. After providing this definition to a newly diagnosed man with ADHD, he slapped his knee and exclaimed, “That’s it! My boss always said that if he needed something from me in 10 minutes, he got it in 5 minutes; if he needed it from me in 10 days, it took me a month.”

Executive functions have generally been viewed as a single factor, but according to Kessler et al. (2010), some semi-distinct factors relevant to day-to-day life are the following:

- Time management
- Organization/problem solving
- Self-motivation
- Impulse control (inhibition)
- Emotional management

Although counted among the executive functions, motivation holds a distinct place in the contemporary view of ADHD. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain that provides you with the sense of reward and pleasure in different situations. Individuals with ADHD have less dopamine available in the brain’s reward networks (Volkow et al., 2011). Thus, it is more difficult for someone with ADHD to generate the drive to engage in a task unless it is inherently enjoyable, or if there is some other strong incentive for doing so, such as the pressure of a deadline. There is also an aversion to the delay of rewards (i.e., delay of gratification). This delay makes it more difficult to generate the motivation to persist toward longer-range goals even though you logically know that they are important. Many tasks in daily adult life are important, but not necessarily exciting, such as running a household, keeping up with work, or managing finances. Even priority tasks that are personally fulfilling may involve short-term inconvenience, such as exercise or staying in touch with friends you don’t see often.

This executive function/motivation model provides a useful framework for understanding and assessing ADHD as well as designing targets for treatment. More investigation is needed to understand the dynamic interactions of brain processes that underlie ADHD, but we now have a good understanding of what needs to be done to promote behavior change.

## Development of the Adult ADHD Tool Kit

When we started the University of Pennsylvania’s Adult ADHD Treatment and Research Program in 1999 (March 8, to be exact), there was not much in the way of research-based treatments for adult ADHD. Medications offered a solid starting point seeing as there were many FDA approved medications, primarily within the stimulant class, that were effective for children and adolescents and for which there was research on their effectiveness for adults. However, it was not until 2003 that there was FDA approval of a medication specifically for ADHD in adults.

It was apparent that medications alone, while beneficial and essential for most adults with ADHD, did not provide sufficient treatment. That is, many patients continued to struggle with various quality-of-life or functional issues in their lives. Life problems and impairments related to executive function/motivation deficits persisted despite symptom improvements provided by medications (and in some cases patients stopped medications due to side effects). Hence, there was a need for adjunctive psychosocial treatments that represent psychotherapy approaches modified to address the common issues faced by adults with ADHD.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has emerged as the psychosocial treatment of choice for adult ADHD based on research supporting its effectiveness, most often in combination with medications. CBT is a well-researched form of psychotherapy that was originally developed by University of Pennsylvania psychiatrist Dr. Aaron T. Beck (1976), and it has been applied to a variety of emotional and behavioral problems. In an all-too-brief nutshell, CBT emphasizes the interplay of thoughts and behaviors and their influence on emotional reactions. Interventions emphasize coping strategies designed to help individuals recognize and change distorted thoughts and to develop adaptive behavior patterns.

Negative thoughts have nothing to do with why someone has ADHD, but they often arise in the wake of the various life frustrations commonly experienced by adults with ADHD. Thus, adults with ADHD may have pessimistic and otherwise negative attitudes about projects at work, homework, managing finances, and virtually any responsibility of adult life that is associated with emotional frustration that, in turn, is the result of the various executive function/motivation problems characteristic of ADHD.

The effects of ADHD magnify and are magnified by the mounting stress associated with tasks that non-ADHD adults seem to complete easily. Consequently, there develops a braided cord of living with ADHD, coping frustrations, negative thoughts, emotional distress or discomfort, and avoidant behavior patterns that lead most, if not all, of our patients to express the desperation that we introduced at the start of the chapter—“I know exactly what I need to do, but I just cannot do it.”

Based on the observation of these patterns in our patients, we developed a model of CBT designed to address the needs of adults with ADHD. We have published open outcome studies and case studies based on our approach, as well as our treatment manual (Ramsay & Rostain, 2008). When asked to write a revised and updated second edition of the manual (Ramsay & Rostain, 2015), we recalled that the most common piece of feedback we received from readers of the first edition (both professional and lay readers) was the desire for even more specific “how-to-do-it” guidance for coping with ADHD. Hence, this tool kit is meant to be a patient handbook that is a companion to the second edition of the treatment manual.

We present the coping strategies in a logical sequence starting with planning and prioritizing tasks and moving on to other essential coping skills. The later chapters focus on the application of these strategies in various real world adult roles and settings, including some special topics toward the end of the book. Thus, in addition to the various internal coping strategies related to managing executive dysfunction, attitudes and self-esteem, behavioral strategies, and dealing with emotions and motivation, we discuss putting these strategies into action at school, at work, in relationships, and various other contexts; hence the subtitle of the tool kit is, *Coping Inside and Out*.

The coping strategies themselves are probably not earth-shattering to you. They are similar to those that have been developed and studied independently and concurrently by our professional colleagues at other adult ADHD programs around the world. We have the utmost regard and respect for these clinical programs and they (and their publications) are listed in the Appendices. However, as our colleagues would all agree, it is the implementation of these skills that is the key to making positive changes in your life.

The externalization of information is a helpful coping skill for managing ADHD. Seeing plans or skills written out instead of trying to hold them in your mind increases the likelihood of being able to execute them. Even though you know how to perform the strategies listed herein, it is important to have reminders. Consequently, each chapter includes a discussion of the common barriers to follow-through and targeted suggestions for ways to increase your implementation of these skills. The most convincing reinforcement of these skills and what will increase the likelihood of their becoming habits is your actual gut-level experience that “This works. I can do this, even when I do not feel like doing it.” To this end, we use various take away reminders, metaphors, movie lines, and other ways to try to make the coping strategies “sticky,” so that they stay with you and so that you will be more likely to use them when you need them.

In the spirit of using one of these reminders, our goal is for you to have the experience that Woody Allen’s character described in the movie *Husbands and Wives* when facing a potentially compromising situation: “Right now I’m feeling $30,000 of psychoanalysis dialing 9-1-1.” We want you to “remember to remember” to use these skills when it counts in your life.

Before you delve into the chapters, we want to set realistic expectations for the change process. That is, change is difficult. Even when you are logically aware that a behavior is not working, there is likely some benefit you gain from it, even if it is short-lasting and trivial. For example, delaying homework provides a temporary sense of relief (i.e., escape) from facing a potentially frustrating task. Although there may not be any new postings on your Facebook page, scanning through friends’ profiles seems preferable in that moment to starting on yard work. There are countless other examples of difficulties taking small steps toward a longer-range goal you want to achieve, but that require initial, though fleeting and mild discomfort. However, this is the nature of ADHD—a problem following through on the initial step toward a long-range goal in the absence of a near-enough reward.

Thus, this handbook is yet another tool that holds the promise of being helpful. Moreover, we can say definitively that these coping strategies will work when used, based on over 20 clinical outcomes studies from different researchers that reported positive results obtained from CBT for adult ADHD. When we start working with patients in CBT, however, we start by setting specific and realistic goals for treatment. Trying to do too much too soon results in feeling overwhelmed and disappointed by lack of progress; on the other hand, doing too little and not committing to making some changes results in similar disappointment that “nothing has changed.”

We encourage our patients to “start small.” Find a starting point and target a specific behavior in a specific setting (e.g., “I will go through and organize my mail each day this week.”). Also identify a positive behavior related to this target to increase (e.g., “I will take bills and other items requiring action and put them in a shoe box on my desk.”) and an interfering behavior to decrease (e.g., “I will not sit down in front of the TV until I have checked the mail.”). The process is similar to how Mr. Miyagi taught karate to Daniel Larusso in the movie *The Karate Kid*. Unbeknownst to Daniel, the seemingly gratuitous chores assigned to him to wax the car, sand the floor, and paint the fence and house were designed to train him in the essential martial arts skills, revealed in the classic “wax on, wax off” scene.

Behavior change often follows a “two steps forward, one step back” scenario and it is important to normalize that there will setbacks. These experiences provide opportunities to strengthen the use of the coping strategies and to develop trust in your resilience.

Our hope for this tool kit is that it is a go-to resource to help you better manage the effects of ADHD and be able to follow through on your endeavors. To that end, the pages herein are meant to be read, used, marked up, dog-eared, and be accessible when needed, akin to a tool kit, which we adopted as the title. In this spirit, let us propose the first take away points to help you get started using this tool kit.

# 2 What Do You Have to Do? The To-Do List

In Chapter 1, we reviewed the current view of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a problem related to executive function/motivational deficits. That is, executive functions represent the self-regulation that allows you to identify and follow through on tasks across time in order to achieve personally relevant objectives. The issue for most people with ADHD is not an absence of goals or lack of desire, but rather the fact that ADHD interferes with the consistent follow-through on the step-by-step process over time to achieve those goals, especially when the payoff does not follow soon enough. For example, we all want to be in better physical shape, but it is difficult to follow through on the daily routine of eating better and exercising until we start to see the results we want.

The issue for adults with ADHD is that it is even harder for them to break down long-term or big goals into step-by-step plans and then consistently follow these plans. To this end, it is essential to have plans throughout your day that are concrete and specific. These intentions help to create the structure and flow of your day. This is particularly relevant for days (i.e., weekend) or times of day when you do not have the structure provided by work, school, or other regular commitments. You may have a life situation that requires you to set your own schedule to a large degree, such as being self-employed, a graduate student working on a dissertation, or a stay-at-home parent. Chapter 3 will focus on using a Daily Planner as a tool for organizing and arranging your schedule. For now, though, your task is to determine the specific tasks you will perform on a particular day that, when put together, will form the scaffolding for your day.

Apart from providing the structure for your day, task selection and prioritization reflect how you choose to “spend yourself,” including your investment of time, effort, and energy. There will be an array of tasks to sort through that include relatively mundane chores associated with running a household (e.g., take out the recycling), necessary errands and tasks (e.g., food shopping, paying bills), recreation, and fostering relationships, and other central personal endeavors (e.g., exercise, work, school).

The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the role of the To-Do List as a tool that helps you to identify, sort through, and prioritize the various tasks and activities that are relevant in your life. There are many steps in using the To-Do List in order to make it manageable and usable. We will differentiate between the Comprehensive and Daily To-Do Lists and discuss ways to prioritize tasks to increase the likelihood of follow-through. The first step in the process is having a plan to plan, and making the time to do so.

## Planning Time to Plan

Although we are introducing the notion of “planning time to plan” here, it will be a recurring issue for time management and other coping skills throughout this workbook. Planning is an investment that requires a small deposit of time and effort at the outset—often much less than you assume—for larger dividends later in the day, week, and month—often much greater than you assume.

An unavoidable reality of coping with adult ADHD is that it requires time and effort to do so. One of the mistaken thoughts held by most adults with ADHD is that “other people do not have to go through all these steps in order to manage their day.” This view may trigger a long held sense of being different from others or serve as a rationalization for not spending the time and effort to work on a To-Do List—it is viewed as “unnatural” or “weird,” and therefore you convince yourself to not do it. You then reassure yourself that “I’ll just figure it out as I go—I have a lot to do and I’ll just start doing things and it all get done.” Unfortunately, skipping the planning step usually leads to the sense at the end of the day that “I was busy and running around all day but I did not accomplish anything important.”

In fact, most non-ADHD adults spend time planning their days and use some form of a To-Do List. Someone without ADHD might be able to get away without writing down or referring back to their tasks lists, and their follow-through appears to be effortless. These individuals probably have developed set routines such that it now requires less effort to maintain them. Truth be told, everybody expends at least some time and effort to orchestrate their day.

In terms of what to do, we recommend spending an “honest” 10 minutes—a full span of 600 seconds—devoted to working on the sorts of planning tasks we will outline below. The only materials needed for working on the To-Do Lists are an electronic word processing file or spreadsheet, notepad feature of a smart phone, or simply (and probably the best way) paper and pen. The simpler, the better is a useful credo.

The more definitive and specific the plan for planning, the better; that is, we advise that you choose a specific place where you will sit to work on your To-Do List and at a realistic time of day when you will have at least 10 minutes to devote to it. Sometimes adults with ADHD describe being distracted by other thoughts or having difficulty focusing at the outset, which is the precise reason we suggest a minimum of a 600 second time commitment—the “honest” 10 minutes to which we refer—at least until planning becomes a habit. This time frame provides you with sufficient time to get engaged in and complete the exercise, and to “remember to remember” what you need to do.

The steps thus far have focused on getting you into the position to construct your plan. It is most helpful if these steps can be made routine, going to the same place at the same time each day to spend your 10 minutes planning. Even when this routine is interrupted, such as being out of town on business, the principles can be adapted to the setting.

In order to prioritize and develop a list of tasks to perform on a particular day, it is necessary to have an understanding of the wide-ranging tasks, responsibilities, and obligations that provide you with a roll call of possible options. Hence, the next section discusses the role of the Comprehensive To-Do List.

> **Take Away 2.1. Planning Time to Plan**
> 1. Devote 10 minutes (600 seconds) to planning.
> 2. Find a place free from distractions.
> 3. Spend an honest 10 minutes (600 seconds) planning out your day.
> 4. Write down your plans in your Daily Planner.
> 5. Define To-Do tasks using specific, behavioral terms for what you will “do.”

## Comprehensive To-Do List

The Comprehensive To-Do List is exactly what its name suggests: an all-encompassing list of your various tasks, responsibilities, and undertakings. It can also be viewed as a “dump list” of all that you have to do. A commonly reported source of distraction and stress for many adults with ADHD is the attempt to keep in mind various obligations throughout the day, with many additional items “popping into mind” at inopportune times, including the awful, too-late recall of things forgotten (e.g., “Oh no, my sister’s birthday was yesterday and I forgot it!”), as well as those looming issues that randomly materialize but are not yet urgent (e.g., “Valentine’s Day falls on a Saturday this year. I’d better not wait until the last minute to make dinner reservations.”).

The Comprehensive To-Do List is an externalized and personalized record of everything you have to do rather than having to hold it in memory. The two-fold purpose for the list is, first, to have a process for thinking through and unloading these tasks and, second, to have an enduring record of them so that you do not have to continually remember and maintain the list in your head.

You will define how “comprehensive” you want your Comprehensive To-Do List to be relative to your circumstances. For the most part, your Comprehensive To-Do List will extend out the next 1 to 6 weeks, with tasks relevant for the next week being most important for your Daily To-Do List. However, there may be upcoming events that require action in the next week or so, such as vacation plans, business trips, passport renewal, or work or school projects that should not wait until the last minute. It is also useful to think through some endeavors that do not have a timeline, but can be defined as tasks to be performed, such as investigating preowned cars to replace yours that is starting to need more and more repairs, making a will, arranging for home repairs, or other tasks that are currently low urgency but will eventually become important.

A common reaction to the proposition of the Comprehensive To-Do List is, “It is too overwhelming for me to think about and face everything I have to do every day.” We agree that it is overwhelming, which is the precise reason to get it out of your head, down on paper (or in an electronic file), and then put in safekeeping for future reference. You may have the experience of an important task popping into your head during the day and then it becomes a distraction from what you are trying to do in the moment, whether it is the fact you are out of milk or need to schedule a car inspection by the end of the month. The Comprehensive To-Do List provides a place to jot down and store these haphazard tasks and ideas.

The periodic review of the Comprehensive To-Do List helps you to remember and define priorities, and to incorporate new tasks and obligations that may have arisen since the previous review. You are not meant to construct a new Comprehensive To-Do List each day; rather it is an exercise to zero in on what are your important short-, mid-, and long-range tasks over the next 6 weeks or so. Then again, many people find it useful to sit down from time to time to review and update their lists or to spend time going through the exercise of periodically reconstructing a new Comprehensive To-Do List from scratch as a way to get a handle on what needs to be done in the coming several weeks (and, honestly, sometimes the lists are misplaced and need to be reconstructed, but this need not be an excuse to abandon the exercise).

> **Take Away 2.2. Comprehensive To-Do List**
> 1. Get a notebook or open a computer file that will be devoted to your Comprehensive To-Do List.
> 2. Find a place free from distractions.
> 3. Write down all of your obligations, plans, errands, commitments, recreational ideas, etc. for the upcoming 1 to 6 weeks (or whatever time frame suits your needs)—this is your “dump list.”
> 4. Store your notebook or computer file in a place where you can retrieve it and refer to it later.
> 5. The Comprehensive To-Do List provides you with reminders of tasks and obligations without relying on your memory. Refer to it periodically for helpful reminders of things that you can do, but this is *not* your Daily To-Do List.

Another way to think about the Comprehensive To-Do List is that it is akin to an iTunes account that holds all your music and video downloads, and various apps. It is a library of all your media. From this account, you can download onto your iPod the items that are of most immediate importance to you. The Daily To-Do List represents your download of specific tasks for completion today, which is discussed in the next section.

## Daily To-Do List

The Daily To-Do List, as its name implies, is a daily list that represents a personalized collection of task reminders that are relevant for you but that run the risk of being forgotten or put off. You probably do not need a reminder to go to work, but you will need to devote an entry on you Daily To-Do List to make a specific business-related phone call or to devote time to a report during your work day. To-Do tasks represent the jobs that require a targeted effort by you to perform in the course of your typical day, such as getting items from the grocery store, scheduling a doctor’s appointment, exercising, or a specific household chore (e.g., unload dishwasher). The Daily To-Do List can also be used to identify specific duties to carry out in other roles, e.g., classroom parent, little league coach, etc.

Whereas the Comprehensive To-Do List is meant to be a record of all your pending responsibilities, the Daily To-Do List is meant to be an easy-to-access, disposable list of tasks for today. That’s why we suggest that the Daily To-Do List be written on a small index card or other piece of paper (e.g., back of an envelope) that can be kept in your pocket or otherwise within easy reach (e.g., posted on a computer monitor or other visible location). The index card’s small size hopefully keeps the task list within reason, with our recommendation being to start with only two or three tasks (and definitely no more than five) in order to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Smartphones and other electronic devices offer easy-to-use and convenient notepad features that can be used for this purpose. An old-school paper version still represents a quicker and easier way to access and refresh the information in your mind. The very act of writing out the list by hand improves the encoding of the tasks and to prime you for behavioral follow-through. In any case, it is important that you decide on a format that will be easiest for you to use and maintain.

Another principle for constructing the Daily To-Do List is to define tasks in specific, behavioral terms in order to increase the likelihood of follow-through. For example, you may have an item on your list that says “clean up kitchen.” Although this is a personally relevant task, worded as such it ends up being too overwhelming because it involves numerous smaller jobs (e.g., unload dishwasher, reload dishwasher, wipe down countertops, clean inside of microwave, organize cupboards, etc.). You run the risk of getting stuck on deciding where to start, feel mounting stress, and end up avoiding the task, usually with a comforting but ultimately self-defeating rationalization, such as “I’ll check my e-mail and then I’ll be ‘in the mood’ to tackle the kitchen.”

An essential coping skill that will come up again in later chapters is that of “breaking large tasks into their component parts.” This skill is not a shocking revelation for anyone with ADHD, but the Daily To-Do List provides an opportunity to implement this skill in specific ways. As was illustrated above, “clean up kitchen” can be more specifically and behaviorally defined as “unload dishwasher and put away clean dishes where they belong,” or whatever initial task seems manageable to you in that moment (e.g., “I will unload the bowls.”). If you complete that task and decide to do no more, that is fine. You may enter another kitchen-related task on your Daily To-Do List for the next day. On the other hand, most adults with ADHD (and everyone else, for that matter) have had the experience that “Once I get started, I usually keep going.” Consequently, the initial specific and behaviorally defined task is designed to get you activated and engaged by making the first step manageable, akin to wading into the shallow end of the swimming pool. This initial step helps you begin, and you will likely end up doing more than you anticipated because the task ends up not being as bad as you anticipated it would be. The principle sounds simple, but it is the implementation of it that makes it effective.

Similar to reserving time to plan, another step you can take to increase follow-through is to define specific times when you will perform tasks on your Daily To-Do List. In effect, you make an appointment with yourself for tasks—including a start time and an end time. You are probably trying to complete tasks on your To-Do List in the midst of managing other commitments and responsibilities during your day, such as meetings at work, attending classes, or driving children to and from various activities. Consequently, you will have to “find time” during the flow of your day to, say, wash a load of laundry or call to schedule an appointment. However, what seemed at the start of the day to be a task easy enough to fit in “somewhere” ends up going undone in the midst of a hectic day.

Devoting discrete increments of time to tasks is another way to keep them manageable (e.g., “I will put a load of laundry in the washer at 7 p.m. I will put it in the dryer at 7:30 p.m. That will leave me plenty of time to relax.”). Again, making the task specific and behavioral helps, such as the reminder “I only have to carry one laundry basket down to the basement, put the clothes in the machine and turn it on. It will take me less than 2 minutes to get it started,” which sounds less onerous than “doing laundry.”

Because there is only so much discretionary time in the course of your day, it is important to prioritize the items you put on your Daily To-Do List. You already dedicate time to work (including working as a stay-at-home parent), school, parenting responsibilities, and other roles (e.g., youth soccer coach, church council, volunteer work) that populate your daily schedule. The Daily To-Do List helps you to reserve time for priority tasks in the precious open slots in your day. Then again, even relatively light, unstructured days benefit from the use of a Daily To-Do List to ensure that desired tasks—including recreational tasks—are completed (see Table 2.1).

# The Adult ADHD Tool Kit

## Preface

Benjamin Franklin said, “You may delay, but time will not, and lost time is never found again.” We are two mental health professionals by trade, a psychologist (J. Russell Ramsay—JRR) and a psychiatrist (Anthony L. Rostain—ALR), who specialize in assessing and treating adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) through our Adult ADHD Treatment and Research Program at the University of Pennsylvania, the institution founded by Franklin. Most patients who seek out our program want to be better able to set out and follow through on their plans, including academic and work tasks, keeping up with errands and personal affairs, and any number of other personally relevant endeavors. The solution seems as simple and obvious as a well-known advertising campaign—“Just do it!” This maxim is not unfamiliar to adults with ADHD; in fact, the core underlying difficulties that define ADHD are directly related to the mechanisms that allow us to “do it.”

Discussions of ADHD focus a great deal on the “A” and the “H,” with the name of the diagnosis and resulting acronym being somewhat misleading. Yes, “A” and “H” represent its symptoms, but they do not adequately describe the ADHD syndrome. ADHD is currently understood as a disorder related to poor self-regulation or self-control—adults with ADHD have problems turning their intentions into the actions that are required to handle many of the demands of daily life. More specifically, it is difficult for adults with ADHD to proactively and consistently develop, organize, and enact and follow through on plans over time for which there is a future (but not immediate) pay off. Instead, ADHD adults repeatedly face the stress of looming deadlines or crisis situations that result from putting off tasks, only being provoked to action by an emergency situation on par with trying to defuse a ticking time bomb.

Think of all the stories and fables we learned as children about the virtues of planning ahead and persevering on a task, such as the little pig that built a house of bricks, the tortoise who keeps a steady pace over a long race with the hare, religious teachings about the benefits of self-restraint and self-control (“Thou shalt NOT . . .”), etc. Each lesson involves deferring immediate gratification for a greater but distant reward. A famous study of self-control led by Walter Mischel had children sit alone in a room with a plate of sweet treats. The children were told that they could have a single treat of their choice, but if they could wait without eating it until the examiner returned to the room, they could earn a second one. Some children, despite the promise of greater reward, succumbed to the temptation to eat the single treat, losing out on the bonus; other children were able to resist temptation long enough to earn the reward of a second treat. The main finding of interest in what has come to be known as the “marshmallow study” is that the impulse control exhibited in childhood predicted later success at all points in life, with the children who were able to defer gratification being better off on average, even 40 years later (Mischel et al., 2011).

Although the lessons and solutions seem straightforward and have been reinforced by grandparents, parents, teachers, bosses, fairy tales, cautionary tales, etc., self-regulation is more multifaceted than it seems. There are many fundamental skills that provide humans with the capacity to do what they want to do or need to do when they need to do it. These skills, known as the executive functions, operate in an exquisite choreography to help us navigate the myriad demands of adult life. Hence, ADHD is currently understood as a disorder of impaired executive functions. That is, the farther in the future the reward for a behavior lay, the greater difficulty an adult with ADHD will have performing the necessary component steps in the here-and-now, thus decreasing the likelihood of achieving the payoff (despite full awareness of the consequences). Alas, the penalties for poor self-control in adulthood are much steeper than the loss of a marshmallow.

ADHD also involves distinct motivational deficits inasmuch as motivation is considered the ability to generate emotions that help you to engage in a task without relying solely on an immediate reward or consequence. Adults with ADHD have difficulties accomplishing jobs that range from setting up a retirement fund (“I’ll get around to it later. I have time.”) to something as immediate as mowing the lawn on a weekend afternoon (“I’ll get around to it later. I have time.”).

As was mentioned earlier, we established and have operated a specialized clinical program for the assessment and treatment of adult ADHD since 1999. An established treatment for ADHD is pharmacotherapy, the use of medications to treat the core symptoms of developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity. Similar to obtaining corrective prescription eyeglasses, effective medication treatment of ADHD reduces the symptoms of ADHD, such as improving the ability to sustain attention and to reduce restlessness and impulsivity. Although an effective and safe treatment for most adults with ADHD, medications alone do not necessarily improve behavioral functioning and well-being in one’s day-to-day life. That is, you may be less prone to distraction and fidgetiness while on a medication, but you will not spontaneously complete your income taxes or get started on a monthly report for work.

The other treatment we provide at our program is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a specific form of psychotherapy that has been adapted to address problems commonly encountered by adults with ADHD. The cognitive in CBT refers to the thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes that affect how we perceive and react to events, as well as our self-perception. Negative thinking has no causal influence on having ADHD, although it often develops as a consequence of growing up and living with ADHD and trying to manage its effects on your life. Said differently, you did not develop difficulties organizing and following through on tasks because you have negative thoughts about them; however, the repeated difficulties you have experienced because of ADHD have likely given rise to pessimistic outlooks about these tasks, which, along with even residual symptoms of ADHD, create a double whammy and make it even harder to follow through on them, that is, insufficient motivation.

The behavioral in CBT refers to one’s actions and to the therapeutic process of developing a more adaptive behavioral repertoire with which to cope with ADHD. Once more, having ADHD does not result from the fact that self-control behaviors were not adequately emphasized by your parents when you were a child or from eating too much sugar-coated cereal. Indeed, individuals with ADHD “know” quite well how to handle the situations that cause them problems. Ask a grade school student with severe ADHD what he should do if he knows the answer to a question asked by the teacher during class, and he will correctly answer, “Raise my hand and wait to be called on by the teacher.” The crux of the problem is that ADHD interferes with the student’s execution of the behaviors required to obey this rule during class.

CBT for adult ADHD, as in other “talk” psychotherapies, involves regularly scheduled office meetings. By necessity, these meetings occur outside the environments in which individuals with ADHD experience the difficulties that bring them to treatment. The necessary solutions for the common problems related to managing ADHD are obvious and logical—use of a planner, getting started earlier on tasks, spending time organizing files, etc.—but the problem is carrying out these solutions in your daily life at the “point of performance.”

In a nutshell, our goal for this tool kit is to share the ways we have tried to make the coping tools for adult ADHD “sticky” so that they will stay with you and you will be able to use them to positive effect in your day-to-day life.

The purpose of this handbook is to serve as a coping resource for adults with ADHD in order to increase the consistent use of effective coping strategies that will improve one’s ability to manage his or her daily affairs. Of course, the notion of a “self-help” or “do-it-yourself” book for adult ADHD, a condition that we have already identified as a problem related to poor self-regulation (i.e., core difficulties with self-help), might seem oxymoronic—or maybe just moronic. The executive function/motivational deficit definition of ADHD we described would make it seem that ADHD interferes with your ability to make changes in a do-it-yourself fashion. We do not expect that simply reading about what you need to do will make you more productive. If that were the case, any one of the excellent books on adult ADHD already on the market would have sufficed.

Rather, we envision this book as akin to a tool kit, an assemblage of a variety of coping tools that can be accessed whenever needed. The strategies herein have been adapted to the needs of adults with ADHD, acknowledging and addressing the very problems that make it difficult to use them. Hence, we emphasize implementation tactics that will increase the likelihood of using these skills at the point of performance, and so that they will be used enough that they will become habitual and less effortful, akin to tasks such as brushing your teeth, making coffee in the morning, or any other task you reliably perform, even on your worst day. Of course, if you find that you have drifted away from using the skills, you can return to a relevant section of the tool kit for a refresher.

Psychologists, counselors, or other nonphysician mental health professionals cannot write prescriptions for medications; however, we can write “behavioral prescriptions” or written reminders of important behavioral strategies. One of the reasons CBT for adult ADHD has been found to be an effective psychosocial treatment for adult ADHD is the focus on the use of coping skills during the 167 hours of the week outside of the weekly therapy hour. Spending time planning how to implement coping strategies during the week and writing out summary coping reminders of the plan increases the likelihood of the timely practice of coping principles outside of the office.

Thus, in addition to discussing foundational coping skills for adult ADHD, many sections of the tool kit will include straightforward “take away” points comprised of a list of step-by-step reminders for instituting them. These take away points offer reminders that can be referred to or carried with you to help you to turn intentions into actions when it counts. Similar to having a recipe for cooking, even if you say “I cannot cook,” you are able to follow each of the individual steps required to prepare a basic dish. The implementation of these strategies sets the stage for the most powerful source of reinforcement in developing coping skills for adult ADHD, which is your “felt experience” when carrying out a plan, seeing positive results, and gaining confidence in your ability to handle situations that previously seemed overwhelming. Just as with cooking, you can personalize the recipes to your unique circumstances, but at the very least, they provide an anchor point to help you get started (or restarted when dealing with coping drift).

This clinical tool kit reflects the principles, skills, and methods used in our clinic, which are very similar to those used by other clinicians with an expertise in adult ADHD. While many of the coping strategies will be familiar to readers of other books on managing adult ADHD, we have tried to emphasize the factors that promote the implementation of the coping skills combined with specific tactics to use in real time. These factors work together to make your coping plans “sticky” so that they go with and are more likely to be carried out and that you can get “unstuck” in various situations in your life.

Of course, no book will be able to address each and every situation you will face, but we have attempted to cover the most common problem areas encountered by adults with ADHD in a way that can be generalized to other situations. We have organized the book in a logical sequence of coping skills from the basics of using prioritizing tasks and your daily schedule to dealing with procrastination and negative thinking to handling different roles in your life as well as maintaining overall well-being. Although adults with ADHD as a group encounter many common and familiar difficulties, each person’s coping needs will be different. Hence, readers are invited to jump to chapters relevant to their specific coping issues and need not read the book in order from beginning to end.

We encourage you to look for ways to get started using the coping skills outlined in the coming chapters but to also be patient with yourself during the change process. We hope that by finding ways to implement these strategies in your daily life, you will notice improvements. However, this sort of change process often involves taking two or three steps forward and then one step backward. Change is hard work and it is important for you to recognize and appreciate progress, even if it is not perfect. For example, maybe a college student reports that he now hands in 80% of his assignments on time after having a semester when he was on time with only 50% of them. Although he strives for 100% timeliness and views himself as still falling short of his goal, we use the reframe that “If you and I invented a medication that helped someone improve this behavior by the same 30% you have achieved, we’d be billionaires right now.” These sorts of positive changes are valid, important to recognize, and will result in improved quality of life without having to use perfection as the benchmark.

To this end, our final wish is that you will use and overuse this tool kit. That is, as with our attempts to provide evidence-supported treatments for adult ADHD that can be personalized, this tool kit provides a useful framework of skills that you and others with ADHD can use and make your own. Using the metaphor of a tool kit, we provide some tools and some instructions for their use; you the reader can use these tools to build newfound opportunities and, more importantly, to be able to “stick with” your endeavors.

## A Note for Mental Health Clinicians

Although written as a handbook for adults with ADHD who are seeking useful coping strategies, this tool kit is also designed to be a resource for clinicians who treat adults with ADHD. This tool kit is a companion to the second edition of our treatment manual, *Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Adult ADHD: An Integrative Psychosocial and Medical Approach* (Ramsay & Rostain, 2015), which provides information about the theoretical underpinnings of the CBT model for adult ADHD, the case conceptualization, more detailed discussion of many of the strategies in this tool kit, reviews of case examples and clinical challenges, and a review of the empirical support for this and similar CBT approaches for adult ADHD. We do not have a session-by-session prescription of topics to address, although this tool kit represents the way we divide up and implement coping skills with patients in sessions.

The development of this handbook stemmed from feedback provided by readers of the first edition of the treatment manual. The most common request was for even more specifics about coping strategies and the “nitty gritty” of how to implement CBT for adult ADHD. Hence, we have tried to encapsulate what we do in collaboration with our patients, including the emphasis on the use and implementation of these skills in daily life, which is the primary measure of their effectiveness. That is to say, we not only discuss the coping strategies but also discuss more specific “tactics” for how they can be put to use.

The tool kit itself provides patients with an externalized reminder for therapeutic exercises to perform as well as a means for personalizing these skills. The take away reminders can be copied to serve as coping cards and provide a means to make between sessions therapeutic exercises “sticky” and portable in order to increase the likelihood that the skills will be implemented at the point of performance. The different chapters could also conceivably be used in a group format, with different chapters providing themes for each meeting.

# Acknowledgments

The authors wish to thank the Routledge/Taylor & Francis Group for supporting us throughout the process of writing this handbook. Dana Bliss was the editor on the first book we wrote and he enthusiastically supported our idea for *The ADHD Tool Kit*. After Dana left Routledge, Anna Moore stepped in and was an equally encouraging and capable guide through the rest of the process.

We would like to thank all of the past and present members of our team at the University of Pennsylvania’s Adult ADHD Treatment and Research Program. Operating a program such as ours requires a great deal of time management and organizational skills, and dedication by all involved to keep it running smoothly. We have been fortunate to work with a variety of talented colleagues and trainees in order to provide evidence-supported assessment and clinical services, as well as to provide training in adult ADHD to the next generation of clinicians.

JRR would like to thank my wife, Amy, and my daughters, Abigail and Brynn, for all the love and support they provide. My mother and sister also deserve thanks for their ongoing encouragement.

One of the principles discussed in this handbook is establishing a work station that becomes a target for and associated with productivity. To this end, JRR would like to give a special word of thanks to the whole team at Main Street Java in Souderton, PA, which is where the vast majority of this book was written (and it will likely be the location for future projects of mine).

ALR would like to thank my wife, Michele, for her forbearance and encouragement, and my family and friends for “being there” for me through thick and thin. ALR also thanks my close colleagues at Penn along with the psychiatry residents whom I’ve had the distinct pleasure of supervising over the years—for providing me with intellectual stimulation and honest feedback.

Finally, we both wish to acknowledge the patients living with ADHD whom we have been privileged to serve since our program started in 1999. We have been awed and moved by their various accounts of adversities in their lives, and inspired by the spirit and strength with which they take on the hard work of facing and transcending ADHD. All of the advice we offer in this handbook has come from our clinical work, and thus we view this book as a tribute to adults with ADHD.

# 1 Introduction

“I know what I need to do, but I just don’t do it. I’ve tried to change on my own, I’ve tried self-help books, and nothing has worked. How is this tool kit going to help me deal with my ADHD when nothing else has worked?”

## Why Should I Expect That This Tool Kit Is Going to Help Me?

This is a reasonable question, but, as with many issues pertaining to Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults, the answer to the simple question is multifaceted.

First, most of the coping skills we will discuss in this tool kit are probably similar, if not identical to those you will find in the many popular books offering advice for coping with adult ADHD. ADHD is not a problem of lack of knowledge about what to do, but rather, it is a performance problem—being unable to reliably do what you set out to do.

Second, because ADHD is a skill performance problem, the similarity of the coping strategies and approaches across different books and programs, and the repetition of this information, is not a bad thing; in fact, having multiple and diverse reminders of these strategies helps to continually refresh the importance of these habits in your life. The combination of the review of the skills with slightly different presentations of these ideas across different formats provides a degree of novelty and offers you different takes on old ideas. Just as in learning, the diverse presentation of ideas and lessons increases the likelihood that these concepts will “stick” and come online during daily life when you need them the most. Diet and exercise books consistently place among the top sellers each year, not because previous books did not provide useful advice, but rather because it is difficult to change these behaviors.

Third, we have been posed a similar question by many patients seeking treatment through our Adult ADHD Treatment and Research Program at the University of Pennsylvania. The question usually takes the form of the one posed at the beginning of the chapter and ends with, “So, what is your treatment approach going to do for me that other treatments have not?”

Our answer has been, “We think we are good at helping adults with ADHD understand how they do not do things they set out to do.” When you are able to recognize in a nuanced and personalized way the ways in which ADHD interferes with your endeavors, you can then find many more pivot points at which to apply specific coping skills.

For example, many adults with ADHD aim to reduce procrastination. They set a goal to “not procrastinate” and attempt to do all the things that they know they are supposed to do—work on a project a little bit each day leading up to a deadline, have a plan of steps to follow, etc. However, most of these ADHD adults will end up falling into old patterns despite the goal to “not procrastinate” and despite the knowledge that they will regret putting things off. They may muddle through by using the pressure of a deadline to complete the task, but end up feeling frustrated and overwhelmed in the process.

It is not enough to know that you procrastinate, but you must understand how ADHD affects your procrastination as you go through your daily life. You need to be aware of the component parts of your procrastination profile. This framework helps you to “see” how you procrastinate and then to use some targeted skills to handle the specific barriers to your follow-through on tasks. Rather than the quick and familiar conclusion that you “procrastinated, again,” instead, you will have a better grasp of the interplay of the effects of ADHD on how you think about, feel about, and manage (or avoid) tasks. In turn, you can employ specific tactics that help you apply your skills in order to change your procrastination “script” (rather than doing the same thing again and hoping for a different outcome).

Fourth and finally, in addition presenting the coping skills that are known to be effective, we emphasize the implementation of these skills. Each of the chapters in this handbook includes discussions of the barriers to follow-through on coping strategies, ways to promote their use, and several step-by-step “take away” reminders for carrying out these skills. You know what you need to do, but understanding the barriers and having a hard copy of instructions akin to a recipe for doing what you need to do greatly increases the likelihood of getting unstuck and getting engaged. Keeping copies of these reminders handy in your daily life is a way to make the coping strategies portable so that you will use them when they are most needed.

Our approach asks a lot from you in terms of your commitment to change. The coping strategies and take away reminders are useful tools but are not immutable laws of physics—they must be used to be helpful. You will have to be willing to face and suspend your doubts about your ability to change. These doubts may be based on past frustrations or a view of yourself as being incapable of change. If your experiences are like those of the untold numbers of patients with ADHD we have seen, you have likely already invested a lot of time, effort, and money in trying to use these sorts of skills with disappointing or at least incomplete results. One of the myths about adult ADHD that we have encountered is the view that the diagnosis is “an excuse” or “an easy way out” of facing hard work. Our experience has been the exact opposite—most adults with ADHD whom we have encountered have worked long and hard to manage the effects of ADHD but grow frustrated with exerting such effort without getting a fair result, working “twice as hard for half as much,” as our professional colleague Dr. Steve Copps has said. We hope that the approach described in this handbook will help you to get much better returns from the investment of your time and efforts.

A starting point in this endeavor is to arrive at a shared understanding of what is ADHD in order to understand, in fact, what it is that you are trying to manage better. We will begin with a brief background on the diagnosis and history of ADHD. This review will conclude with a contemporary, scientifically supported model for understanding ADHD and the difficulties with disorganization, poor time management, impulsivity, procrastination, motivation, etc. that people experience in their daily lives. Finally, we will extend this model of ADHD to the coping strategies discussed in this tool kit, our emphasis on implementation, and provide the rationale for this handbook and set up a context for its use.

## Adult ADHD Background

Despite claims that ADHD is solely an outgrowth of the frenetic pace of 21st century lifestyles in Western society, there has likely been ADHD as long as there have been human brains. The date of the first appearance of ADHD-related phenomena in clinical writings has moved from 1902 and the publication of George Still’s (1902/2006) lectures on overactive and inattentive children to the late 18th century and the writings of the physician Alexander Crichton (1798/2008), and most recently, settling on 1775 and the observations of Melchior Adam Weikard (Barkley & Peters, 2012). The salient point is that ADHD is not a recent syndrome and that it has caused problems for affected individuals wherever and whenever it is found.

Nonetheless, the advent of compulsory education in the 20th century created a situation in which children entered classrooms, en masse. A classroom filled with children that is presided over by a single teacher for several hours of instruction is a setting that requires a reasonable degree of developmentally appropriate self-control. Moreover, this context shed light on behavioral and learning difficulties that may have been covered up in other situations (Hinshaw & Scheffler, 2014).

The syndrome now known as ADHD was given a variety of names over the years before being first described in the second edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-II; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1968) as the “hyperkinetic reaction of childhood (or adolescence)” with a 22-word description, including the assurance that “the behavior usually diminishes in adolescence.” The diagnosis was renamed as Attention Deficit Disorder (either with or without Hyperactivity) in DSM-III (APA, 1980) and DSM-III-R (APA, 1987). Many people continue to refer to the disorder as Attention Deficit Disorder or ADD, even though it was renamed as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in DSM-IV (APA, 1994). ADHD is listed in the fifth edition of (DSM-5; APA, 2013) under the section on neurodevelopmental disorders. ADHD can be further specified by different presentations: Predominantly Inattentive Presentation, Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive Presentation, and Combined Presentation.

Stimulant medications were found by accident to be a helpful treatment that led to improved attention and self-control in children. There have been studies of various forms of psychosocial and educational interventions to further improve functioning, mostly by adapting the child’s environment through teacher and parent training.

Research studies since the 1960s revealed that children with ADHD had ongoing difficulties into adolescence and adulthood, but the notion of adult ADHD did not gain wide notoriety until the 1990s with the publication of several popular books on the topic. Cross-sectional and longitudinal research has indicated that ADHD persists in well over 50% of children diagnosed with ADHD, probably closer to two-thirds of them. Lower persistence rates are often obtained when strict diagnostic criteria are used that may not adequately capture the manifestations of symptoms in adults with ADHD. It is estimated that 4.4% of the adult population in the United States exhibits ADHD, with similar prevalence rates (3.4%) obtained in international samples (Fayyad et al., 2007; Kessler et al., 2006).

The past 20+ years have witnessed a rise in genetic and neuroimaging research aimed at understanding the etiology of ADHD. For instance, ADHD is known to have complex genetic underpinnings for which there are different pathways and forms, unlike a simple genetic trait, such as eye color. The advent of neuroimaging technology has shed light on the architecture and workings of different brain regions implicated in the manifestations of ADHD. Multiple brain systems have been implicated in ADHD that individually and in concert add to our conceptualization of the symptoms of ADHD, as well as the variety of developmental trajectories and clinical presentations of the syndrome.

A meeting point for this and other research on ADHD has been the executive functions. Although difficult to define precisely, the executive functions have been described as higher-order cognitive skills that manage and choreograph a variety of brain functions in order to efficiently and adequately address the demands of our environment. Metaphors of “conductor” or “manager” often are invoked to illustrate the role of the executive functions on behavior.

ADHD is currently considered a developmental disorder of impaired executive functions. Using a definition established by Dr. Russell Barkley, the executive functions represent

> the use of self-directed actions so as to choose goals and to select, enact, and sustain actions across time toward those goals usually in the context of others often relying on social and cultural means for the maximization of one’s longer-term welfare as the person defines that to be.
> (Barkley, 2012, p. 176)

Said differently, individuals with ADHD have problems organizing and following through on tasks and endeavors that will create a desired long-term outcome, but for which there is not sufficient short-term reward. After providing this definition to a newly diagnosed man with ADHD, he slapped his knee and exclaimed, “That’s it! My boss always said that if he needed something from me in 10 minutes, he got it in 5 minutes; if he needed it from me in 10 days, it took me a month.”

Executive functions have generally been viewed as a single factor, but according to Kessler et al. (2010), some semi-distinct factors relevant to day-to-day life are the following:

- Time management
- Organization/problem solving
- Self-motivation
- Impulse control (inhibition)
- Emotional management

Although counted among the executive functions, motivation holds a distinct place in the contemporary view of ADHD. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain that provides you with the sense of reward and pleasure in different situations. Individuals with ADHD have less dopamine available in the brain’s reward networks (Volkow et al., 2011). Thus, it is more difficult for someone with ADHD to generate the drive to engage in a task unless it is inherently enjoyable, or if there is some other strong incentive for doing so, such as the pressure of a deadline. There is also an aversion to the delay of rewards (i.e., delay of gratification). This delay makes it more difficult to generate the motivation to persist toward longer-range goals even though you logically know that they are important. Many tasks in daily adult life are important, but not necessarily exciting, such as running a household, keeping up with work, or managing finances. Even priority tasks that are personally fulfilling may involve short-term inconvenience, such as exercise or staying in touch with friends you don’t see often.

This executive function/motivation model provides a useful framework for understanding and assessing ADHD as well as designing targets for treatment. More investigation is needed to understand the dynamic interactions of brain processes that underlie ADHD, but we now have a good understanding of what needs to be done to promote behavior change.

## Development of the Adult ADHD Tool Kit

When we started the University of Pennsylvania’s Adult ADHD Treatment and Research Program in 1999 (March 8, to be exact), there was not much in the way of research-based treatments for adult ADHD. Medications offered a solid starting point seeing as there were many FDA approved medications, primarily within the stimulant class, that were effective for children and adolescents and for which there was research on their effectiveness for adults. However, it was not until 2003 that there was FDA approval of a medication specifically for ADHD in adults.

It was apparent that medications alone, while beneficial and essential for most adults with ADHD, did not provide sufficient treatment. That is, many patients continued to struggle with various quality-of-life or functional issues in their lives. Life problems and impairments related to executive function/motivation deficits persisted despite symptom improvements provided by medications (and in some cases patients stopped medications due to side effects). Hence, there was a need for adjunctive psychosocial treatments that represent psychotherapy approaches modified to address the common issues faced by adults with ADHD.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has emerged as the psychosocial treatment of choice for adult ADHD based on research supporting its effectiveness, most often in combination with medications. CBT is a well-researched form of psychotherapy that was originally developed by University of Pennsylvania psychiatrist Dr. Aaron T. Beck (1976), and it has been applied to a variety of emotional and behavioral problems. In an all-too-brief nutshell, CBT emphasizes the interplay of thoughts and behaviors and their influence on emotional reactions. Interventions emphasize coping strategies designed to help individuals recognize and change distorted thoughts and to develop adaptive behavior patterns.

Negative thoughts have nothing to do with why someone has ADHD, but they often arise in the wake of the various life frustrations commonly experienced by adults with ADHD. Thus, adults with ADHD may have pessimistic and otherwise negative attitudes about projects at work, homework, managing finances, and virtually any responsibility of adult life that is associated with emotional frustration that, in turn, is the result of the various executive function/motivation problems characteristic of ADHD.

The effects of ADHD magnify and are magnified by the mounting stress associated with tasks that non-ADHD adults seem to complete easily. Consequently, there develops a braided cord of living with ADHD, coping frustrations, negative thoughts, emotional distress or discomfort, and avoidant behavior patterns that lead most, if not all, of our patients to express the desperation that we introduced at the start of the chapter—“I know exactly what I need to do, but I just cannot do it.”

Based on the observation of these patterns in our patients, we developed a model of CBT designed to address the needs of adults with ADHD. We have published open outcome studies and case studies based on our approach, as well as our treatment manual (Ramsay & Rostain, 2008). When asked to write a revised and updated second edition of the manual (Ramsay & Rostain, 2015), we recalled that the most common piece of feedback we received from readers of the first edition (both professional and lay readers) was the desire for even more specific “how-to-do-it” guidance for coping with ADHD. Hence, this tool kit is meant to be a patient handbook that is a companion to the second edition of the treatment manual.

We present the coping strategies in a logical sequence starting with planning and prioritizing tasks and moving on to other essential coping skills. The later chapters focus on the application of these strategies in various real world adult roles and settings, including some special topics toward the end of the book. Thus, in addition to the various internal coping strategies related to managing executive dysfunction, attitudes and self-esteem, behavioral strategies, and dealing with emotions and motivation, we discuss putting these strategies into action at school, at work, in relationships, and various other contexts; hence the subtitle of the tool kit is, *Coping Inside and Out*.

The coping strategies themselves are probably not earth-shattering to you. They are similar to those that have been developed and studied independently and concurrently by our professional colleagues at other adult ADHD programs around the world. We have the utmost regard and respect for these clinical programs and they (and their publications) are listed in the Appendices. However, as our colleagues would all agree, it is the implementation of these skills that is the key to making positive changes in your life.

The externalization of information is a helpful coping skill for managing ADHD. Seeing plans or skills written out instead of trying to hold them in your mind increases the likelihood of being able to execute them. Even though you know how to perform the strategies listed herein, it is important to have reminders. Consequently, each chapter includes a discussion of the common barriers to follow-through and targeted suggestions for ways to increase your implementation of these skills. The most convincing reinforcement of these skills and what will increase the likelihood of their becoming habits is your actual gut-level experience that “This works. I can do this, even when I do not feel like doing it.” To this end, we use various take away reminders, metaphors, movie lines, and other ways to try to make the coping strategies “sticky,” so that they stay with you and so that you will be more likely to use them when you need them.

In the spirit of using one of these reminders, our goal is for you to have the experience that Woody Allen’s character described in the movie *Husbands and Wives* when facing a potentially compromising situation: “Right now I’m feeling $30,000 of psychoanalysis dialing 9-1-1.” We want you to “remember to remember” to use these skills when it counts in your life.

Before you delve into the chapters, we want to set realistic expectations for the change process. That is, change is difficult. Even when you are logically aware that a behavior is not working, there is likely some benefit you gain from it, even if it is short-lasting and trivial. For example, delaying homework provides a temporary sense of relief (i.e., escape) from facing a potentially frustrating task. Although there may not be any new postings on your Facebook page, scanning through friends’ profiles seems preferable in that moment to starting on yard work. There are countless other examples of difficulties taking small steps toward a longer-range goal you want to achieve, but that require initial, though fleeting and mild discomfort. However, this is the nature of ADHD—a problem following through on the initial step toward a long-range goal in the absence of a near-enough reward.

Thus, this handbook is yet another tool that holds the promise of being helpful. Moreover, we can say definitively that these coping strategies will work when used, based on over 20 clinical outcomes studies from different researchers that reported positive results obtained from CBT for adult ADHD. When we start working with patients in CBT, however, we start by setting specific and realistic goals for treatment. Trying to do too much too soon results in feeling overwhelmed and disappointed by lack of progress; on the other hand, doing too little and not committing to making some changes results in similar disappointment that “nothing has changed.”

We encourage our patients to “start small.” Find a starting point and target a specific behavior in a specific setting (e.g., “I will go through and organize my mail each day this week.”). Also identify a positive behavior related to this target to increase (e.g., “I will take bills and other items requiring action and put them in a shoe box on my desk.”) and an interfering behavior to decrease (e.g., “I will not sit down in front of the TV until I have checked the mail.”). The process is similar to how Mr. Miyagi taught karate to Daniel Larusso in the movie *The Karate Kid*. Unbeknownst to Daniel, the seemingly gratuitous chores assigned to him to wax the car, sand the floor, and paint the fence and house were designed to train him in the essential martial arts skills, revealed in the classic “wax on, wax off” scene.

Behavior change often follows a “two steps forward, one step back” scenario and it is important to normalize that there will setbacks. These experiences provide opportunities to strengthen the use of the coping strategies and to develop trust in your resilience.

Our hope for this tool kit is that it is a go-to resource to help you better manage the effects of ADHD and be able to follow through on your endeavors. To that end, the pages herein are meant to be read, used, marked up, dog-eared, and be accessible when needed, akin to a tool kit, which we adopted as the title. In this spirit, let us propose the first take away points to help you get started using this tool kit.

# 2 What Do You Have to Do? The To-Do List

In Chapter 1, we reviewed the current view of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a problem related to executive function/motivational deficits. That is, executive functions represent the self-regulation that allows you to identify and follow through on tasks across time in order to achieve personally relevant objectives. The issue for most people with ADHD is not an absence of goals or lack of desire, but rather the fact that ADHD interferes with the consistent follow-through on the step-by-step process over time to achieve those goals, especially when the payoff does not follow soon enough. For example, we all want to be in better physical shape, but it is difficult to follow through on the daily routine of eating better and exercising until we start to see the results we want.

The issue for adults with ADHD is that it is even harder for them to break down long-term or big goals into step-by-step plans and then consistently follow these plans. To this end, it is essential to have plans throughout your day that are concrete and specific. These intentions help to create the structure and flow of your day. This is particularly relevant for days (i.e., weekend) or times of day when you do not have the structure provided by work, school, or other regular commitments. You may have a life situation that requires you to set your own schedule to a large degree, such as being self-employed, a graduate student working on a dissertation, or a stay-at-home parent. Chapter 3 will focus on using a Daily Planner as a tool for organizing and arranging your schedule. For now, though, your task is to determine the specific tasks you will perform on a particular day that, when put together, will form the scaffolding for your day.

Apart from providing the structure for your day, task selection and prioritization reflect how you choose to “spend yourself,” including your investment of time, effort, and energy. There will be an array of tasks to sort through that include relatively mundane chores associated with running a household (e.g., take out the recycling), necessary errands and tasks (e.g., food shopping, paying bills), recreation, and fostering relationships, and other central personal endeavors (e.g., exercise, work, school).

The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the role of the To-Do List as a tool that helps you to identify, sort through, and prioritize the various tasks and activities that are relevant in your life. There are many steps in using the To-Do List in order to make it manageable and usable. We will differentiate between the Comprehensive and Daily To-Do Lists and discuss ways to prioritize tasks to increase the likelihood of follow-through. The first step in the process is having a plan to plan, and making the time to do so.

## Planning Time to Plan

Although we are introducing the notion of “planning time to plan” here, it will be a recurring issue for time management and other coping skills throughout this workbook. Planning is an investment that requires a small deposit of time and effort at the outset—often much less than you assume—for larger dividends later in the day, week, and month—often much greater than you assume.

An unavoidable reality of coping with adult ADHD is that it requires time and effort to do so. One of the mistaken thoughts held by most adults with ADHD is that “other people do not have to go through all these steps in order to manage their day.” This view may trigger a long held sense of being different from others or serve as a rationalization for not spending the time and effort to work on a To-Do List—it is viewed as “unnatural” or “weird,” and therefore you convince yourself to not do it. You then reassure yourself that “I’ll just figure it out as I go—I have a lot to do and I’ll just start doing things and it all get done.” Unfortunately, skipping the planning step usually leads to the sense at the end of the day that “I was busy and running around all day but I did not accomplish anything important.”

In fact, most non-ADHD adults spend time planning their days and use some form of a To-Do List. Someone without ADHD might be able to get away without writing down or referring back to their tasks lists, and their follow-through appears to be effortless. These individuals probably have developed set routines such that it now requires less effort to maintain them. Truth be told, everybody expends at least some time and effort to orchestrate their day.

In terms of what to do, we recommend spending an “honest” 10 minutes—a full span of 600 seconds—devoted to working on the sorts of planning tasks we will outline below. The only materials needed for working on the To-Do Lists are an electronic word processing file or spreadsheet, notepad feature of a smart phone, or simply (and probably the best way) paper and pen. The simpler, the better is a useful credo.

The more definitive and specific the plan for planning, the better; that is, we advise that you choose a specific place where you will sit to work on your To-Do List and at a realistic time of day when you will have at least 10 minutes to devote to it. Sometimes adults with ADHD describe being distracted by other thoughts or having difficulty focusing at the outset, which is the precise reason we suggest a minimum of a 600 second time commitment—the “honest” 10 minutes to which we refer—at least until planning becomes a habit. This time frame provides you with sufficient time to get engaged in and complete the exercise, and to “remember to remember” what you need to do.

The steps thus far have focused on getting you into the position to construct your plan. It is most helpful if these steps can be made routine, going to the same place at the same time each day to spend your 10 minutes planning. Even when this routine is interrupted, such as being out of town on business, the principles can be adapted to the setting.

In order to prioritize and develop a list of tasks to perform on a particular day, it is necessary to have an understanding of the wide-ranging tasks, responsibilities, and obligations that provide you with a roll call of possible options. Hence, the next section discusses the role of the Comprehensive To-Do List.

> **Take Away 2.1. Planning Time to Plan**
> 1. Devote 10 minutes (600 seconds) to planning.
> 2. Find a place free from distractions.
> 3. Spend an honest 10 minutes (600 seconds) planning out your day.
> 4. Write down your plans in your Daily Planner.

## Comprehensive To-Do List

The Comprehensive To-Do List is exactly what its name suggests: an all-encompassing list of your various tasks, responsibilities, and undertakings. It can also be viewed as a “dump list” of all that you have to do. A commonly reported source of distraction and stress for many adults with ADHD is the attempt to keep in mind various obligations throughout the day, with many additional items “popping into mind” at inopportune times, including the awful, too-late recall of things forgotten (e.g., “Oh no, my sister’s birthday was yesterday and I forgot it!”), as well as those looming issues that randomly materialize but are not yet urgent (e.g., “Valentine’s Day falls on a Saturday this year. I’d better not wait until the last minute to make dinner reservations.”).

The Comprehensive To-Do List is an externalized and personalized record of everything you have to do rather than having to hold it in memory. The two-fold purpose for the list is, first, to have a process for thinking through and unloading these tasks and, second, to have an enduring record of them so that you do not have to continually remember and maintain the list in your head.

You will define how “comprehensive” you want your Comprehensive To-Do List to be relative to your circumstances. For the most part, your Comprehensive To-Do List will extend out the next 1 to 6 weeks, with tasks relevant for the next week being most important for your Daily To-Do List. However, there may be upcoming events that require action in the next week or so, such as vacation plans, business trips, passport renewal, or work or school projects that should not wait until the last minute. It is also useful to think through some endeavors that do not have a timeline, but can be defined as tasks to be performed, such as investigating preowned cars to replace yours that is starting to need more and more repairs, making a will, arranging for home repairs, or other tasks that are currently low urgency but will eventually become important.

A common reaction to the proposition of the Comprehensive To-Do List is, “It is too overwhelming for me to think about and face everything I have to do every day.” We agree that it is overwhelming, which is the precise reason to get it out of your head, down on paper (or in an electronic file), and then put in safekeeping for future reference. You may have the experience of an important task popping into your head during the day and then it becomes a distraction from what you are trying to do in the moment, whether it is the fact you are out of milk or need to schedule a car inspection by the end of the month. The Comprehensive To-Do List provides a place to jot down and store these haphazard tasks and ideas.

The periodic review of the Comprehensive To-Do List helps you to remember and define priorities, and to incorporate new tasks and obligations that may have arisen since the previous review. You are not meant to construct a new Comprehensive To-Do List each day; rather it is an exercise to zero in on what are your important short-, mid-, and long-range tasks over the next 6 weeks or so. Then again, many people find it useful to sit down from time to time to review and update their lists or to spend time going through the exercise of periodically reconstructing a new Comprehensive To-Do List from scratch as a way to get a handle on what needs to be done in the coming several weeks (and, honestly, sometimes the lists are misplaced and need to be reconstructed, but this need not be an excuse to abandon the exercise).

> 2. Find a place free from distractions.
> 3. Write down all of your obligations, plans, errands, commitments, recreational ideas, etc. for the upcoming 1 to 6 weeks (or whatever time frame suits your needs)—this is your “dump list.”
> 4. Store your notebook or computer file in a place where you can retrieve it and refer to it later.
> 5. The Comprehensive To-Do List provides you with reminders of tasks and obligations without relying on your memory. Refer to it periodically for helpful reminders of things that you can do, but this is *not* your Daily To-Do List.

Another way to think about the Comprehensive To-Do List is that it is akin to an iTunes account that holds all your music and video downloads, and various apps. It is a library of all your media. From this account, you can download onto your iPod the items that are of most immediate importance to you. The Daily To-Do List represents your download of specific tasks for completion today, which is discussed in the next section.

## Daily To-Do List

The Daily To-Do List, as its name implies, is a daily list that represents a personalized collection of task reminders that are relevant for you but that run the risk of being forgotten or put off. You probably do not need a reminder to go to work, but you will need to devote an entry on you Daily To-Do List to make a specific business-related phone call or to devote time to a report during your work day. To-Do tasks represent the jobs that require a targeted effort by you to perform in the course of your typical day, such as getting items from the grocery store, scheduling a doctor’s appointment, exercising, or a specific household chore (e.g., unload dishwasher). The Daily To-Do List can also be used to identify specific duties to carry out in other roles, e.g., classroom parent, little league coach, etc.

Whereas the Comprehensive To-Do List is meant to be a record of all your pending responsibilities, the Daily To-Do List is meant to be an easy-to-access, disposable list of tasks for today. That’s why we suggest that the Daily To-Do List be written on a small index card or other piece of paper (e.g., back of an envelope) that can be kept in your pocket or otherwise within easy reach (e.g., posted on a computer monitor or other visible location). The index card’s small size hopefully keeps the task list within reason, with our recommendation being to start with only two or three tasks (and definitely no more than five) in order to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Smartphones and other electronic devices offer easy-to-use and convenient notepad features that can be used for this purpose. An old-school paper version still represents a quicker and easier way to access and refresh the information in your mind. The very act of writing out the list by hand improves the encoding of the tasks and to prime you for behavioral follow-through. In any case, it is important that you decide on a format that will be easiest for you to use and maintain.

Another principle for constructing the Daily To-Do List is to define tasks in specific, behavioral terms in order to increase the likelihood of follow-through. For example, you may have an item on your list that says “clean up kitchen.” Although this is a personally relevant task, worded as such it ends up being too overwhelming because it involves numerous smaller jobs (e.g., unload dishwasher, reload dishwasher, wipe down countertops, clean inside of microwave, organize cupboards, etc.). You run the risk of getting stuck on deciding where to start, feel mounting stress, and end up avoiding the task, usually with a comforting but ultimately self-defeating rationalization, such as “I’ll check my e-mail and then I’ll be ‘in the mood’ to tackle the kitchen.”

An essential coping skill that will come up again in later chapters is that of “breaking large tasks into their component parts.” This skill is not a shocking revelation for anyone with ADHD, but the Daily To-Do List provides an opportunity to implement this skill in specific ways. As was illustrated above, “clean up kitchen” can be more specifically and behaviorally defined as “unload dishwasher and put away clean dishes where they belong,” or whatever initial task seems manageable to you in that moment (e.g., “I will unload the bowls.”). If you complete that task and decide to do no more, that is fine. You may enter another kitchen-related task on your Daily To-Do List for the next day. On the other hand, most adults with ADHD (and everyone else, for that matter) have had the experience that “Once I get started, I usually keep going.” Consequently, the initial specific and behaviorally defined task is designed to get you activated and engaged by making the first step manageable, akin to wading into the shallow end of the swimming pool. This initial step helps you begin, and you will likely end up doing more than you anticipated because the task ends up not being as bad as you anticipated it would be. The principle sounds simple, but it is the implementation of it that makes it effective.

Similar to reserving time to plan, another step you can take to increase follow-through is to define specific times when you will perform tasks on your Daily To-Do List. In effect, you make an appointment with yourself for tasks—including a start time and an end time. You are probably trying to complete tasks on your To-Do List in the midst of managing other commitments and responsibilities during your day, such as meetings at work, attending classes, or driving children to and from various activities. Consequently, you will have to “find time” during the flow of your day to, say, wash a load of laundry or call to schedule an appointment. However, what seemed at the start of the day to be a task easy enough to fit in “somewhere” ends up going undone in the midst of a hectic day.

Devoting discrete increments of time to tasks is another way to keep them manageable (e.g., “I will put a load of laundry in the washer at 7 p.m. I will put it in the dryer at 7:30 p.m. That will leave me plenty of time to relax.”). Again, making the task specific and behavioral helps, such as the reminder “I only have to carry one laundry basket down to the basement, put the clothes in the machine and turn it on. It will take me less than 2 minutes to get it started,” which sounds less onerous than “doing laundry.”

Because there is only so much discretionary time in the course of your day, it is important to prioritize the items you put on your Daily To-Do List. You already dedicate time to work (including working as a stay-at-home parent), school, parenting responsibilities, and other roles (e.g., youth soccer coach, church council, volunteer work) that populate your daily schedule. The Daily To-Do List helps you to reserve time for priority tasks in the precious open slots in your day. Then again, even relatively light, unstructured days benefit from the use of a Daily To-Do List to ensure that desired tasks—including recreational tasks—are completed (see Table 2.1).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---|---|
| 9 – 9:05 a.m. | Return customer phone call—Inform him that the quote I gave him is the lowest I can offer. |
| 1 – 1:30 p.m. | Make calls to prospective new customers. Start at top of spreadsheet compiled on Friday. Dial the number and use the script you made up to get started. |
| 4:50 – 5 p.m. | Call HR department. Ask about status of tuition reimbursement request. |
| 6 – 6:30 p.m. | Stop by grocery store on way home from train station—remember milk. |
| 7:45 – 9 p.m. | Drive to gym. Start with 30 minutes on elliptical machine. |

There is great flexibility in how you select, rank, and prioritize tasks. A three-level hierarchy can be used to identify high-, medium-, or low-priority tasks, with some people using color-coding to identify different levels of priority (e.g., green, yellow, red). The four quadrant approach in which tasks are assessed in terms of their ratings (high vs. low) on the domains of urgency and importance provides an externalized format for assessing the relative priority of tasks (Covey, Merrill, & Merrill, 1994). The goal of the quadrant model is to expend most effort on those tasks high in importance but low in urgency (i.e., Quadrant II), which is a rubric used in Mary Solanto’s (2011) group cognitive behavioral therapy approach for adult ADHD. Planning your Daily To-Do List gives you time gauge the relative priority of different tasks in order to tease apart the most important ones.

Many adults with ADHD say that they make lists and identify priority tasks but do not reliably carry them out. At the same time, it is challenging to balance these tasks with other competing obligations in your life. Again, these problems are variations on the theme “I know what I need to do, but I just don’t do it” or “I’ve tried lists before, but they do not work for me.” These complaints are consistent with the view of ADHD as a performance deficit.

The Daily To-Do Lists are not ends in-and-of themselves but rather portable reminders of hand-picked tasks that are a subset of everything you have to juggle in the course of a day. Making the tasks behavioral and manageable, then, represents an implementation-focused approach. The next section provides more detailed tactics to aid in the implementation of specific tasks that have made the cut for your Daily To-Do List.

## “Enter the Room with a Plan”

Writing out your Daily To-Do List and reviewing it throughout the day is designed to help you keep track of these priorities. Each review and reminder is an exposure to something you would typically avoid and primes you for action instead of letting these important tasks fall prey to poor memory or “finding yourself” engaged in distractions.

The reminder to “enter the room with a plan” is a useful credo to keep your priorities foremost in your mind at the point of performance. One of the challenges of ADHD is inhibiting the impulse to do something else that is more interesting but less important than what you set out to do.

Entering the room with a plan entails reminding yourself of your reason for entering a room, store, or opening a computer file, or any other action that is part of your immediate task plan. Getting something you need for a project or switching between tasks are vulnerable times during which you are prone to distraction, such as catching a glance of something else that needs to be done. Entering the room with a plan gives you a target to get past a risky situation, such as being tempted to click on the Internet icon when opening a computer file you need for a work project (e.g., “I am going to work on the report until 1 p.m. and then I can ‘play.’”). This coping reminder can also help you return to a task when you find yourself digressing aimlessly at home or at the office at times that you want to be productive (“I came downstairs to get paper for the printer. I will get it and go back upstairs to finish my work.”).

In this vein, it is crucial to anticipate common triggers for distraction and escape from tasks, and to develop preemptive plans for dealing with them. For example, let’s say you set out to work at your desk but anticipate that coworkers will stop by to invite you to get coffee or that you get an e-mail that offers an excuse to stop working. There is research to suggest that coming up with an “if-then” plan for managing these possible interruptions will increase the likelihood you will stay on task (Gawrilow, 2011), that is, “If someone invites me to get coffee, then I will thank him but say that I must keep working on this project” or “If I see an interesting e-mail, then I will remind myself that I can read it after I finish my time on the task.” Making these implementation plans explicit increases the likelihood of effective follow-through.

Returning to the definition of ADHD as characterized by difficulties organizing behavior across time, it stands to reason that you need a tool that helps you to bring together and orchestrate various tasks and obligations over the course of a day, week, and month. The Daily Planner is a tool and a process to manage the tasks identified on To-Do Lists and to fit them in within the context of other demands of your daily life. Although it is a distinct coping skill that will be discussed in the next chapter, the Daily Planner represents the final step in the “To-Do List” domain of coping strategies for adult ADHD.

# 3 How Do You Spend Yourself? The Daily Planner

As we will repeat throughout this handbook, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is not a knowledge deficit but rather a performance deficit insofar as it is difficult for adults with ADHD to convert intentions into actions. The previous chapter focused on the issue of identifying, organizing, and prioritizing various plans into manageable tasks and keeping track of them using a portable Daily To-Do List. The current chapter focuses on the Daily Planner as a tool for defining times in one’s day, week, or month that are designated for action on your objectives, as well as to arrange all of your obligations and commitments.

When you think about it, the Daily Planner is a simple tool. Fundamentally, any planner is composed of a series of empty columns and rows, with the columns representing a single day and the rows representing increments of time within that day. This straightforward format lets you survey all that must be done and provides you with a sense of the “flow” of your day. These rows and columns serve as containers for time and allow you to strategize how you want to spend these increments of time.

It is recommended that the Daily Planner become your companion throughout the day. As with many other coping strategies focused on externalizing information, the Daily Planner is similar to a flash drive or the cloud for your brain, a device that offers more memory capacity than is provided by your neural circuitry. The process involved in developing the Daily To-Do List and entering it into the Daily Planner represents cognitive rehearsal of the coming day and helps with its encoding, although the main benefit of having a record of your daily schedule is that you can refer to it throughout the day and do not have to remember what needs to be done.

There are several aspects of using the Daily Planner that will help you make an informed choice about a system that will be most helpful to you. Likewise, there are several suggestions for getting the most out of your Daily Planner that will be discussed below. The first step in using a Daily Planner, however, is choosing a Daily Planner.

## Choosing a Daily Planner

It would seem as though the choice of a Daily Planner system is as easy as going to the nearest office supply store or simply tapping the calendar feature on your smartphone. As with most aspects of coping with ADHD, however, it is important to take a pause and make an informed decision about the type of system that will work best for you and that you will use over the long haul.

The first choice about a Daily Planner boils down to “paper or digital.” Do you prefer a traditional daily calendar, such as a spiral-bound appointment book, or using the calendar feature on an electronic device that can be synchronized with your computer? Both options are feasible, but the deciding factors should be the format that will be most portable and convenient to use, and will serve its fundamental purpose: to provide a means to record and track your daily plan.

At first blush, it would seem that the digital version wins this argument, hands down. That is, smartphones, computer tablets, and/or other electronic devices already have an established place alongside wallets, keys, purses, and so on as the essential “tools of daily life.” These gadgets are convenient, portable, and have alarms that provide important reminders.

Our observation over our years of working with many adults with ADHD, however, is that despite all these benefits, digital calendars are underutilized as a coping tool for ADHD. People generally do not reference their smartphone or computer tablet calendar enough during the day, and we hear the lament, “I had it in my phone, but did not check it.” Alarm systems can be used as reminders for tasks, but these are imperfect. An alarm that goes off 30 minutes before a scheduled meeting is not helpful if you are in a shopping mall 60 minutes away from where you will need to be. Moreover, multiple alarms on a smartphone have become akin to car alarms—we hear them go off but are desensitized to them and ignore them. That said, some people are “wired in and synched up” throughout the day, and they make good use of electronic calendars, though this still seems to be only a small minority of adults with ADHD we see.

Traditional paper Daily Planners offer an easy-to-use format that is simpler to access than a digital calendar. In addition to being able to quickly grab and open a planner, it can be referred to during the day to see “what is next” or can lay flat on a desk where you can glance at it. You are able to see your day, week, or month in a single view rather than having to scroll through several small screens. We mentioned earlier that writing entries in your planner helps encode this information. Likewise, glancing at a record of upcoming tasks helps “prime” you for action. The Daily Planner also provides a diary of sorts inasmuch as you have a collection of past schedules that can be referred to when necessary (e.g., “When was the last time I had the car in for an oil change?”).

The drawback of the paper Daily Planner is that it can be forgotten, misplaced, or lost, which is also a risk for electronic devices. Size and portability are important considerations, and the planner should provide adequate space in which to log your commitments. Some people make due with a monthly calendar with a single square for each day, while others need a day-by-day schedule with 15-minute increments throughout each day.

We recommend using a paper Daily Planner, though it is ultimately your choice in terms of what fits your lifestyle. It is not a forever decision and you may start with one format and later switch to the other. Once deciding on the planner, it is the implementation of the Daily Planner that determines its usefulness. In the next few sections, we discuss some general principles for the use of the planner before spending Chapter 4 outlining the implementation of the Daily Planner as a tool.

> **Take Away 3.1. Choosing a Daily Planner and General Guidelines**
> 1. Decide on paper vs. electronic planning system—if in doubt, start with paper planner.
> 2. Find a planner size and format that fits the scheduling demands of your life.
> 3. Plan to “overuse” your Daily Planner. It is a place for scheduled appointments, work and school commitments, as well as personal, recreational, and self-care tasks.
> 4. Err on the side of “underscheduling,” leaving enough buffer time between tasks and meetings.
> 5. Keep your “task appointments” as specific and behavioral as possible.
> 6. Define start times and end times for tasks and activities, whenever possible—“lower the bar.”
> 7. Your Daily Planner is a “tool of daily life,” along with your keys, wallet, purse, cell phone, etc.

## (Over)use It or Lose It

We discussed the choice of what type of Daily Planner you will use. Whatever system you decide on, it is important to remember that something is better than nothing. The ultimate benefit of the Daily Planner depends on how you use it in your daily life. As with buying a gym membership, you must use it to attain the desired results.

Even among ADHD adults who consistently use a Daily Planner, it is still often underutilized. The Daily Planner is not only for use for professional appointments or dates for exams in school, but also to be used to help you to manage your personal, social, recreational, and other discretionary time and activities throughout each day.

The planner provides scaffolding with which to plan and organize your day. Rather than “winging it,” it is essential to schedule times for tasks, including reserving time for basic needs, such as meals, sleep, and other self-care tasks. In fact, including these sorts of activities in your schedule helps you appreciate how much time and effort these tasks require.

## Self-Care Activities

As we alluded to above, it is important to consider self-care, including your health and well-being, as prioritized tasks, such as exercise, reading, hobbies, and simple downtime. You may think that these are the “easy” tasks that already take up too much of your time and that you need to focus on more productive tasks. Yes, you are more likely to procrastinate on important obligations that are not immediately reinforcing. However, ADHD interferes with planning and following through on personal interests, too. We do not want you to give up enjoyable activities but rather to be more mindful about how they fit into your day and to be proactive in reserving time for them as rewards for time spent on other tasks.

An aspect of the choreography of your schedule is managing your energy and effort. It is vital to schedule breaks throughout the day, including time for meals or exercise, etc. A side effect of the distraction and poor self-monitoring features of ADHD is that you may not notice signals that you are hungry, tired, or other cues about your current physical state that affect functioning. Reserving time for self-care provides stop gaps to make sure you attend to your well-being.

One of the barriers to prioritizing self-care is the thought, “I cannot think about exercise when I have so much to do” (or the more punitive thought, “I mismanaged my time earlier in the day and therefore I cannot justify allowing myself to still exercise.”). We view “self-care” (including recreational) tasks as crucial to promoting follow-through on other “work” and “school” tasks or any other important obligations. Rather than “wasting time,” self-care is essential to promoting overall well-being and efficiency. There will be times, of course, when a situation dictates that you sacrifice a self-care task for another priority (e.g., “I will have to skip my downtime on the Internet tonight in order to prepare for my presentation tomorrow.”). For the most part, however, it is beneficial to maintain self-care behaviors and to not deny yourself the advantages that sleep, exercise, and healthy diet provide.

## Err on the Side of Underscheduling

At the same time we promote overutilizing your Daily Planner, we encourage you to err on the side of underscheduling. In the spirit of “starting small,” when in doubt, schedule fewer rather than more tasks and give yourself more buffer time between tasks and appointments than may seem necessary, at least as you become accustomed to your Daily Planner. Executive function deficits make it more difficult for you to gauge and monitor how much time it takes to perform tasks, how much transition time is needed between tasks, and what constitutes your realistic pace throughout the day. Thus, it is better to start small and gradually build up your schedule.

We propose a “less-is-more” mindset, at least at the outset of using the Daily Planner. Similar to the notion of setting limits on the number of items on the Daily To-Do List to avoid becoming overwhelmed, allow yourself time to become familiar with the planner and the pace and choreography of your day. It will take some time and effort for you to develop the habit of consistently using the planner and finding the right choreography of tasks, and your pace for completing them. Remember, you are not only managing time and tasks, but your effort and energy as well.

## Define Start and End Times for Tasks

Many tasks and meetings have discrete (or at least reasonably predictable) start and end times, such as college classes, meetings at work, church services, television programs, a time-based exercise routine (e.g., yoga class, 30 minutes on treadmill), and so on. These sorts of activities are easier to schedule and maneuver around other commitments in your Daily Planner because they are time bound.

Many projects do not have such defined time commitments. You may plan to do some housework or work on a paper for a class, but no one else will know if you do not end up following through on these tasks. It is easy to rationalize that “I can work on this later.” In fact, if you do work on it later, then it is not a problem. However, most adults with ADHD describe putting off tasks until they are facing either a time deadline, such as the due date for a project, or an untenable situation, such as not having any clean clothes, or a room reaching an upsetting level of disorganization and clutter.

Tasks without definitive endpoints are more challenging to plan. You probably have seen electronic signs on highways around large cities that alert drivers to the estimated travel time to various exits and interchanges. Even if there will be a delay, it has been found that drivers can adjust their attitudes and expectations and thereby lower their frustration levels when given a specific time estimate to their destination rather than it being unclear (Vanderbilt, 2008). It is the same with tasks entered in the Daily Planner—it is helpful to know when they start as well as when they will end as a means to adjust expectations in order to promote follow-through.

Many adults with ADHD declare that they “work best at the last minute,” but the people who seek out help for ADHD have usually encountered significant problems stemming from this pattern of “brinksmanship.” Even if you are able to pull an “all-nighter” or spend marathon sessions catching up on work or chores (which is romanticized as “hyperfocus”), these strategies come at a cost to you and your physical and emotional well-being. Establishing end times for tasks helps guard against the risk of falling into this crisis pattern.

Using the format of the Daily Planner, a coping strategy you can use for open-ended tasks is to schedule realistic start and end times. Projects such as working on a research paper for college, a presentation for work, or cleaning up and organizing a room at home can be daunting, and several hours can be spent on any one of these important tasks without reaching completion. Although these are exactly the sorts of tasks for which you want to reserve time in your Daily Planner, there will likely never be an adequate chunk of time to complete them in one sitting. In fact, even if you do have an open schedule without any commitments, it is not likely that you or anyone will schedule and follow-through on an 8-hour block of time devoted to “clean and organize my bedroom” or “write the assigned 20-page paper.” You do not devote that much time to activities you enjoy, much less a chore or an assignment.

The notion of scheduling start and end times for projects, first and foremost, is meant to set realistic and achievable expectations for task performance, particularly those that are not naturally enjoyable or “motivating.” Using the example from above, you may not be able to commit to 8 hours of cleaning up a room, but you will be able to handle 30 minutes. You are still working on a chore, but you are narrowing your focus and expectations by defining an increment of time for a task that is manageable and helps you to get engaged in a productive activity. This coping strategy is another specific step involved in “breaking down tasks” to make them more doable. Rather than attempting to raise your motivation for the task, you can “lower the bar” and set a more reasonable expectation.

A second benefit of having start and end times is that it makes it easier to schedule tasks, which, in turn, promotes follow-through. These tasks are probably the sort that you will want to include on your Daily To-Do List. This approach is particularly helpful when working on a large undertaking that cannot be completed all at once. You define a specific part of the project to work on during a specified block of time, which allows you to make headway without becoming overwhelmed (and then procrastinating).

Lastly, the use of start and end times for tasks is a useful way to handle days in which you have a great deal of discretionary time, such as a vacation day or a weekend. This is not to say that you must be “productive” all day and scheduled in each available block of time. However, this approach helps to define some reasonable tasks (including recreation and downtime) that provide anchors during the day and to guard against the experience of reaching the end of a “free day” and feeling that it was wasted.

You may be thinking that “I have used lists and calendars before but still did not follow them.” You are correct that the Daily Planner is a tool, and it must be used in order to achieve benefits. Even constructing a well-planned schedule still only represents a blueprint for the day and does not guarantee performance—planning is not doing. The next chapter will focus in more detail on the use of the Daily Planner to promote time and task management and the implementation of your plans.

# 4 Define, Prioritize, and Choreograph What You Do
## Time and Task Management

Once you have a sense of your Comprehensive To-Do List, your prioritized Daily To-Do List, and a Daily Planner system, you have the basic tools with which to manage your time, tasks, effort, and energy. Akin to learning to play chess, while understanding the rules of the game and the defined moves for each of the pieces is essential, there is the distinct skill of playing the game and contending with an opponent. In a similar fashion, you may have developed many ornate lists and well-designed plans in the past but did not keep to them. Thus, it is in how you play the time management game that determines how well you manage your Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This chapter will focus on the time management “moves” and tactics that will help you to put together the different skills and tools we have discussed thus far in order to follow through on plans.

## Review the Daily Planner—Early and Often

One of the principles we mentioned early in this handbook is the need to transform coping strategies into routine habits in your daily life. One of the foundational habits is the regular use and review of the Daily Planner, which is ideally done in tandem with making the Daily To-Do List.

We recommend that you establish specific times dedicated to sitting down, setting up, and tracking your plan for the day. Most people find that spending a 10-minute block of time either at the beginning or end of their day (or both) helps establish the habit of thinking through the plan and recording it in the Daily Planner. A stay-at-home parent may plan out a day the night before; an office worker often can start a work day by sitting down at his desk and setting out the day’s agenda; and workers whose jobs are more fluid, such as salespeople or contractors, often have to revise their plans throughout the day in order to accommodate opportunities that pop up. Time spent planning is also a good way to decide how to make use of unstructured or discretionary time. For example, it is beneficial to think through how you want to use your weekend or a 2-hour break between classes, either for recreation or to run errands that are tough to fit in during a typical day.

We recommend at least 10 minutes—an honest 600 seconds—for these daily planning sessions. We say an “honest” 10 minutes/600 seconds to point out that planning requires at least several minutes to accomplish adequately instead of the more common use of “10 minutes” to suggest an imprecise, but brief, time (e.g., “Give me 10 minutes to take care of things and then I’ll stop by your office”). Such a time frame is short enough that it is feasible, yet it provides you enough time for this crucial step in your day. You will soon find that this 10-minute investment reaps dividends by saving time and effort throughout the day that would otherwise be lost to scrambling to address problems that could have been avoided.

The Daily Planner is designed to be referenced throughout the day, allowing you to repeatedly revisit your plan and to keep you on track. You should be glancing at it throughout the day to see what you have completed, make adjustments to your plans (if needed) and remind yourself of what is coming up later that day, in the evening, or later that week. This habit allows you to keep tabs on your time and tasks in manageable increments and to identify some useful anchor points throughout the day that can help you to pace yourself as you move from task to task (e.g., “I will finish working on this project and then I have a lunch break.”).

As your Daily Planner assumes its place among your “tools of daily life” (i.e., keys, cell phone, wallet, purse, etc.), you will use it to schedule upcoming commitments, such as social events, exams, meetings, appointments, etc. as they arise. In addition to organizing your day, the time spent thinking about and planning your activities is a “priming” activity that increases the likelihood of behavioral follow-through.

## Write Down All of Your Existing Obligations

The best way to get started using your Daily Planner is to populate that day’s schedule with all of your existing obligations for that day, even if they seem obvious and routine. Your Daily Planner is akin to a financial budget with a daily account of 24 hours to be “spent.” Your existing obligations represent standard expenses, such as utilities, taxes, etc. that are deducted from your budget. Thus, time in classes, meetings at work, pick up times from preschool, yoga class, etc. all are entered into your Planner to represent deductions from your 24 hours.

Thinking through the flow of your day and your different roles is another way to recognize all that you already get done, which adults with ADHD often underestimate. Commitments such as a meeting with a teacher at school, an errand to run for your church or synagogue, picking up a package at the post office, attending a review session at school, or a scheduled meeting at work all belong in the planner. Make sure to include planned exercise, “appointment television,” or a planned get-together with a friend. Remember to account for travel times and to reserve time for basic self-care, namely the morning wake-up routine, meals, various household chores, and sleep. The Daily Planner is a coping tool that externalizes time and allows you to see how all of your tasks and obligations fit together rather than relying on your “sense” of time, which is often faulty.

Some day’s schedules will include obligations specific to a particular day of the week, such as attending religious services, a weekly exercise class, or a standing volunteer commitment. Of course, the Daily Planner is a useful tool for keeping track of less frequent, stand-alone obligations, such as semiannual dental or medical visits, meeting with an accountant during tax season, parent-teacher conferences, or other professional appointments.

## Define Tasks for Your Daily To-Do List

After establishing the main obligations and tasks in your day, it is important to coordinate your schedule with your Daily To-Do List, the portable record of specific priority tasks for that day. Items on your Daily To-Do List can be scheduled in your Daily Planner, such as running a special errand or devoting time to an important project for work or school. For example, you may have a standing 2 p.m. class each Monday that is listed in your Daily Planner as an obligation, but you need not put that on your Daily To-Do List. If you are scheduled to make a presentation in the next meeting of that class, however, you can reserve the break before that class in your Planner for your final preparations, which is a task entered on the Daily To-Do List.

The Daily Planner is akin to the Google Maps feature in which you can start with a wide view of the general area and the route you will take. Similar to the map feature, you can telescope in on progressively more detailed views of individual weeks, days, and portions of a single day. The Daily To-Do List becomes the street level view in which, after defining the time of day it will be performed, you arrive at that task for performance using step-by-step directions. Of course, as with good directions, it is important to have useful and accurate steps for these tasks, which we discuss next.

## Breaking Down a Task into Its Steps

There are a series of philosophical problems known as Zeno’s paradoxes. One of them says that as you attempt to leave a room, you must first reach the midpoint between you and the exit. As you continue toward the doorway, you will again reach the new midpoint, with each successive attempt to exit the room requiring you to reach the next midpoint. The paradox is that you should be unable to leave a room because you can infinitely halve the distance to the exit without ever getting out of the room.

You may often feel like you are the person trying to leave the room when facing tasks on your Daily To-Do List inasmuch as it seems as though you can never get them started. We use the Zeno’s paradox example to illustrate that most tasks you will encounter can be broken down into ever-smaller component steps. More importantly, taking the right first step on a task gives you the sense that “I can do this,” a seemingly small matter that holds big rewards.

When setting out your priority tasks, you will encounter some undertakings that activate a sense of dread, an overwhelmed feeling, or thoughts that you cannot deal with them. Rather than automatically avoiding them (“I can’t handle this now!”), the first step is to consider what you want to accomplish and if your task, at least as you currently think of it, is too big or vague. The overall objective is still important, such as “organize my room” or “work on paper for school,” but framed in such broad terms it is hard to picture a way to get started.

As with the example of leaving a room, you can divide the large project into its component steps. Thus, “organize my room” is broken down into the separate tasks of removing clutter that does not belong in the room, deciding what items will stay in the room, and identifying where each of these items will be stored. Even the first step of removing clutter might be too stressful. If that is the case, this step can be shrunk down to focus on a specific item, such as “I will start by picking up any dishes in my room and take them to the kitchen.”

Similarly, a work or school project is comprised of different steps. There may be data that need to be compiled or analyzed before delving into the monthly report write-up. Time spent organizing one’s thoughts or outlining a paper is a helpful way for a student to begin a project from having to jump right into writing. Even once you have started your write-up, you may procrastinate on getting back to the unfinished paper. The goal of “continue to write the report” seems daunting, so, an initial, smaller step toward this end can be framed as “I will read the last paragraph I wrote and I will then write the first sentence of the next paragraph.”

The principles to remember here are to define the task in simple and behavioral terms in order to turn the task objective into an action you can perform. You will be able to find a way to reduce most tasks into the smallest, behavioral first step that you feel capable to perform in order to overcome procrastination. A straightforward way to first “touch” many work and school projects is to make sure you have accurate information about the parameters of the task, due date, etc. (e.g., “I will check the syllabus to make sure I am clear about the assignment.”). Simply opening the computer file for a work project or picking up the textbook to be read for a class represent simple action steps that greatly increase the likelihood of taking a next step on the task (see Table 4.1).

Time spent visualizing and planning the task itself represents a small first step of engagement and is an exposure exercise that fosters your ability to face something that you typically avoid and escape. A spreadsheet, a sheet of paper, or index cards can be used to tease apart the different steps of a large project steps, including your start point, the desired end point, and all the steps in between. This exercise is particularly beneficial when a task is large and has a future deadline. This sort of project requires “doing a little bit” each day rather than being stuck doing everything at the last minute in a panic. Even if you plan to devote an hour or two on a single day to a task, such as chores, errands, or yard work, it is useful to have a plan for breaking down and ordering your steps (including a reward). Breaking a task down into a manageable step is an essential strategy to help you to get started and to stay on track.
